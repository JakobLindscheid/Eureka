To create a reward function that encourages the humanoid to run as fast as possible, we will utilize the velocity component from the `root_states` variable. Specifically, the objective is to maximize the forward velocity of the humanoid. Here's a reward function implementing these ideas:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, dof_force_tensor: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract the forward velocity (assuming the target running direction is along the x-axis)
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]
    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]

    # Reward for forward velocity
    reward_velocity = forward_velocity

    # Penalize high joint forces to encourage smooth motion
    force_magnitude = torch.norm(dof_force_tensor, p=2, dim=1)
    penalty_force = torch.exp(-0.01 * force_magnitude)

    # Total reward is the combination of velocity reward and force penalty
    total_reward = reward_velocity * penalty_force

    # Creating a reward dictionary for analysis
    reward_dict = {
        "reward_velocity": reward_velocity,
        "penalty_force": penalty_force
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Key Components:
1. **Velocity Reward (`reward_velocity`)**: This component rewards the humanoid based on its forward velocity. The forward motion is assumed to be predominantly along the x-axis.

2. **Force Penalty (`penalty_force`)**: A penalty based on the norms of the forces acting on the joints. This encourages more efficient, less forceful movements by utilizing an exponentially decaying function which applies a smooth penalty. 

3. **Total Reward (`total_reward`)**: This combines the velocity-based reward and the force penalty to ensure that the humanoid runs fast but efficiently.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 200 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
reward_velocity: ['1.05', '1.45', '3.46', '4.22', '4.45', '4.83', '5.15', '4.95', '5.17', '5.71'], Max: 6.02, Mean: 4.22, Min: 0.60

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Based on the analysis of the policy feedback and the reward components:

1. **Reward Velocity**: This component shows a good range of values, implying it is being optimized effectively. The values suggest that the agent is indeed learning to run faster, which is desirable behavior for this task.

2. **Penalty Force**: The penalty force values are relatively low and close together, which suggests limited impact, possibly due to the exponential function scaling. We could adjust its temperature parameter to potentially make it more sensitive and influence the policy more effectively.

3. **Episode Lengths**: The initial values are very low, indicating failures or non-optimal behavior early in training. As the training progresses, the episode length increases, implying the agent is learning to maintain its activity for longer, which seems appropriate.

To improve the reward function, we should refine the scaling of the force penalty to have a more pronounced effect earlier in training and potentially encourage smoother, more efficient motions. Here's an improved reward function:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, dof_force_tensor: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract the forward velocity (assuming the target running direction is along the x-axis)
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]
    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]

    # Reward for forward velocity with normalization
    velocity_temperature = 0.1
    reward_velocity = torch.exp(forward_velocity * velocity_temperature) - 1.0

    # Revise penalization of high joint forces to encourage smoother motion
    force_temperature = 0.05  # Adjusted temperature parameter to increase sensitivity
    force_magnitude = torch.norm(dof_force_tensor, p=2, dim=1)
    penalty_force = torch.exp(-force_temperature * force_magnitude)

    # Total reward combines velocity reward and force penalty
    total_reward = reward_velocity * penalty_force

    # Create a reward dictionary for analysis
    reward_dict = {
        "reward_velocity": reward_velocity,
        "penalty_force": penalty_force
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Key Changes:
- **Velocity Reward Normalization**: Applied an exponential transformation with a temperature parameter of `0.1` which increases the sensitivity to increases in velocity.
  
- **Force Penalty Adjustment**: Lowered the temperature parameter to `0.05` to make the penalization effect more noticeable and to influence the training policy more effectively.

The revised function aims to balance between encouraging rapid movement and maintaining efficient energy consumption, fostering smoother actions as a result.

Based on the analysis of the policy feedback and the reward components:

1. **Reward Velocity**: The value of the reward for velocity has been relatively low but improving over time. This suggests that the velocity component is being optimized, but there may be potential to encourage even faster speeds by re-scaling it or adjusting its sensitivity.

2. **Penalty Force**: The penalty force component seems to have a broader range than expected, indicating variability and optimization. However, its impact could potentially overshadow the velocity reward due to its values sometimes being significant. It might be beneficial to adjust this to prevent it from discouraging desirable speeds too aggressively.

3. **Task Score and Episode Lengths**: These components are improving over time, indicating that the policy is learning. But the optimization could be better, as indicated by the score and episode lengths not maxing out. 

To improve the reward function, we need to encourage faster speeds by emphasizing velocity more and balancing the force penalty to avoid discouraging acceleration. Here's a revised reward function:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, dof_force_tensor: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract the forward velocity (assuming the target running direction is along the x-axis)
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]
    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]

    # Reward for forward velocity with normalization
    velocity_temperature = 0.2  # Increased sensitivity
    reward_velocity = torch.exp(forward_velocity * velocity_temperature) - 1.0

    # Adjust the penalty for joint forces to have a less negative impact
    force_temperature = 0.02  # Further adjusted to lessen its negative impact
    force_magnitude = torch.norm(dof_force_tensor, p=2, dim=1)
    penalty_force = torch.exp(-force_temperature * force_magnitude)

    # Combined reward encourages velocity while considering force usage
    total_reward = reward_velocity * penalty_force

    # Create a reward dictionary for analysis
    reward_dict = {
        "reward_velocity": reward_velocity,
        "penalty_force": penalty_force
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Changes Made:
- **Increased Velocity Transformation**: The temperature parameter for the velocity reward is increased to `0.2` to put more emphasis on increasing speed, encouraging the humanoid to run faster.
  
- **Decreased Force Penalty Impact**: The temperature parameter for force penalty is reduced to `0.02`, aiming to mitigate its impact on the velocity reward balance, encouraging the agent to not overly penalize for exerting forces if it leads to higher speeds.

This revised function seeks to foster faster running while maintaining control and efficiency in the humanoid's movements.

Let's analyze the policy feedback based on the data provided:

1. **Reward Velocity**: The reward values for velocity show improvement over time, with mean values relatively high, suggesting the velocity component is being optimized. However, the low values at certain points suggest it might benefit from a better incentive mechanism perhaps through adjusting the scaling or temperature parameters for further acceleration.

2. **Penalty Force**: The penalty force values are relatively low and consistent, suggesting it may not be providing a strong learning signal. Increasing the temperature or magnitude could make it a more effective regularizing factor.

3. **Task Score**: The task score shows improvement, suggesting the policy is learning. However, it could potentially reach higher scores with further refinement of the reward function components.

4. **Episode Lengths**: The variation in episode lengths suggests some inconsistency in achieving the task goals efficiently, although it shows a consistent upwards trend indicating learning.

Based on these insights, here is an improved reward function:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, dof_force_tensor: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract the forward velocity (assuming the target running direction is along the x-axis)
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]
    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]

    # Modified reward for forward velocity with adjusted normalization
    velocity_temperature = 0.5  # Increased to add more weight to speed
    reward_velocity = torch.exp(forward_velocity * velocity_temperature) - 1.0

    # Modified force penalty to provide a stronger regularization signal
    force_temperature = 0.05  # Increased to make the penalty more significant
    force_magnitude = torch.norm(dof_force_tensor, p=2, dim=1)
    penalty_force = torch.exp(-force_temperature * force_magnitude) - 1.0  # Adjusted to provide a more negative penalty

    # Combine the reward components, emphasizing velocity more
    total_reward = reward_velocity + 0.5 * penalty_force  # Adjusted weighting to balance velocity and force

    # Create a reward dictionary for analysis
    reward_dict = {
        "reward_velocity": reward_velocity,
        "penalty_force": penalty_force
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Adjustments Made:
- **Increased Velocity Reward Temperature**: The temperature parameter for the velocity reward is increased to `0.5`, emphasizing the need to run faster by providing stronger incentives for velocity.

- **Increased Force Penalty Temperature**: The force penalty's temperature parameter is increased to `0.05`, aiming to provide a more noticeable penalty for high forces to ensure smooth and efficient movement.

- **Weighted Combination**: The total reward now adds the adjusted weighted penalty, allowing the agent to feel the impact of excessive force usage more prominently, while still primarily focusing on increasing speed. 

This revised reward function should better encourage the humanoid to maintain a balance between running speed and efficient movement control.

Based on the feedback from the policy training:

1. **Velocity Reward Component**: The values for `reward_velocity` range significantly, with mean considerably higher than other components, suggesting it is being optimized effectively but might need scaling for stability and balancing with other components.

2. **Penalty Force Component**: The values for `penalty_force` are identical and constant at `-1.00`, indicating that this component is not providing useful feedback. The reward structure may need adjustment or reconsideration for relevance to the task.

3. **Task Score and Episode Length**: The task score is increasing, and episode lengths are extending significantly, meaning there is improvement but likely room for further optimization of task-specific behavior.

Given this analysis, the new reward function should:

- Adjust the force penalty to a relevant and varied scale.
- Ensure all components combine effectively to balance the emphasis on pursuing high velocity with controlled, stable movements.

Here is the improved reward function:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, dof_force_tensor: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract the forward velocity (assuming the target running direction is along the x-axis)
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]
    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]

    # Modified reward for forward velocity, with scaling
    velocity_temperature = 0.3  # Reduced to moderate the scale
    reward_velocity = torch.exp(forward_velocity * velocity_temperature) - 1.0

    # Re-write the force penalty with a larger force threshold consideration
    max_force_thr = 200.0  # Example threshold for normalizing
    force_temperature = 0.01  # Fine-tuned temperature parameter
    force_magnitude = torch.norm(dof_force_tensor, p=2, dim=1) / max_force_thr
    penalty_force = torch.clamp(1.0 - force_temperature * force_magnitude, min=-1.0, max=0.0)

    # Combine the reward components
    total_reward = reward_velocity + penalty_force

    # Create a reward dictionary for analysis
    reward_dict = {
        "reward_velocity": reward_velocity,
        "penalty_force": penalty_force
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Adjustments Made:
- **Velocity Reward Scaling**: The temperature for the velocity reward has been decreased to `0.3` to adjust its range, promoting stability and better interplay with other components.

- **Force Penalty Component Redesigned**: The force penalty is replanned to consider normalized forces relative to a `max_force_thr`, with a clamped output to simplify its scaling between reasonable bounds for negative penalty feedback.

This improved reward function aims to maintain rapid progress while applying more controllable mechanical forces, supporting more stable policies potentially resulting in better task-specific performance in running and maintaining balance.
