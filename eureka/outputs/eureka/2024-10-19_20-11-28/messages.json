As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.).

        "content": "Based on the feedback from the policy training:\n\n1. **Velocity Reward Component**: The values for `reward_velocity` range significantly, with mean considerably higher than other components, suggesting it is being optimized effectively but might need scaling for stability and balancing with other components.\n\n2. **Penalty Force Component**: The values for `penalty_force` are identical and constant at `-1.00`, indicating that this component is not providing useful feedback. The reward structure may need adjustment or reconsideration for relevance to the task.\n\n3. **Task Score and Episode Length**: The task score is increasing, and episode lengths are extending significantly, meaning there is improvement but likely room for further optimization of task-specific behavior.\n\nGiven this analysis, the new reward function should:\n\n- Adjust the force penalty to a relevant and varied scale.\n- Ensure all components combine effectively to balance the emphasis on pursuing high velocity with controlled, stable movements.\n\nHere is the improved reward function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Tuple, Dict\n\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, dof_force_tensor: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Extract the forward velocity (assuming the target running direction is along the x-axis)\n    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]\n    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]\n\n    # Modified reward for forward velocity, with scaling\n    velocity_temperature = 0.3  # Reduced to moderate the scale\n    reward_velocity = torch.exp(forward_velocity * velocity_temperature) - 1.0\n\n    # Re-write the force penalty with a larger force threshold consideration\n    max_force_thr = 200.0  # Example threshold for normalizing\n    force_temperature = 0.01  # Fine-tuned temperature parameter\n    force_magnitude = torch.norm(dof_force_tensor, p=2, dim=1) / max_force_thr\n    penalty_force = torch.clamp(1.0 - force_temperature * force_magnitude, min=-1.0, max=0.0)\n\n    # Combine the reward components\n    total_reward = reward_velocity + penalty_force\n\n    # Create a reward dictionary for analysis\n    reward_dict = {\n        \"reward_velocity\": reward_velocity,\n        \"penalty_force\": penalty_force\n    }\n\n    return total_reward, reward_dict\n```\n\n### Adjustments Made:\n- **Velocity Reward Scaling**: The temperature for the velocity reward has been decreased to `0.3` to adjust its range, promoting stability and better interplay with other components.\n\n- **Force Penalty Component Redesigned**: The force penalty is replanned to consider normalized forces relative to a `max_force_thr`, with a clamped output to simplify its scaling between reasonable bounds for negative penalty feedback.\n\nThis improved reward function aims to maintain rapid progress while applying more controllable mechanical forces, supporting more stable policies potentially resulting in better task-specific performance in running and maintaining balance."
