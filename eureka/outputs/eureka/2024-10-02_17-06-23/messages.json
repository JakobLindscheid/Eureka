        "content": "Based on the policy feedback provided, we will analyze each reward component carefully:\n\n### Feedback Analysis\n\n1. **Speed Reward**:\n   - Values are relatively high with a maximum of 2.41 and a mean of 1.68, indicating that the policy has learned to optimize this component. However, the consistently high values point to the possibility that the policy may be overly focused on speed rather than balancing it with alignment or target reach. We should rescale the speed reward to ensure it occupies a more normalized range.\n\n2. **Alignment Reward**:\n   - The highest value is 6.18 with a mean of 4.76. There is a significant spread, but this behavior can lead to a potential disregard for other aspects of the task, similar to the speed reward. This reward component can be rewritten such that it encourages alignment in a more constructive manner and has a temperature parameter to regulate its impact on the total reward.\n\n3. **Target Reach Reward**:\n   - This reward remains at zero across all episodes, indicating it is not providing any useful signal. This necessitates a complete rewrite or reimagining of this reward to ensure it positively influences behavior toward reaching the target.\n\n4. **Movement Penalty**:\n   - This component suggests a light penalty for lack of movement but shows minimal variation (mean of -0.08). This indicates that it may not be strong enough to encourage significant movement. The magnitude of this penalty could be increased to promote more consistent activity.\n\n5. **Task Score**:\n   - The task score shows minimal variation, indicating it is not giving clear guidance for the agent's performance towards the goals. A new formulation should better capture the agent\u2019s success and explicitly reflect the progress made toward the task goal.\n\n6. **Episode Lengths**:\n   - The episode lengths average just above 12, which suggests that while the agent is learning to move, it may not be making significant progress. To encourage longer and more varied episode durations, we need better incentives.\n\n### New Reward Function Proposal\n\nBased on the feedback analysis, we will create a new reward function that seeks to provide a more balanced guidance across the various components, giving the agent a better opportunity to learn effectively:\n\n#### Proposed Reward Function Code:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Tuple, Dict\n\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, dof_vel: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Define temperature parameters for transforming reward components\n    speed_temp = 0.5\n    alignment_temp = 0.2\n    target_reach_temp = 0.5\n    movement_penalty_temp = 0.5  # Increased strength\n\n    # Extract necessary components\n    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]\n    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]\n    \n    # Forward velocity component (capped)\n    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]\n    speed_reward = torch.clamp(forward_velocity / 2.0, min=0.0, max=1.0)  # Scale down speed reward to be within [0, 1]\n\n    # New target reach reward based on inverse distance to target, encouraging closeness\n    distance_to_target = torch.norm(targets - torso_position, p=2, dim=-1)\n    target_reach_reward = torch.exp(-distance_to_target / target_reach_temp)  # Exponential to provide strong feedback\n\n    # Improved alignment reward based on dot product of forward velocity and target direction\n    direction_to_target = targets - torso_position\n    direction_norm = torch.norm(direction_to_target, p=2, dim=-1, keepdim=True) + 1e-6\n    direction_to_target_normalized = direction_to_target / direction_norm  # Normalize the direction vector\n\n    alignment_reward = torch.clamp(torch.sum(velocity * direction_to_target_normalized, dim=-1), min=0.0, max=1.0)\n\n    # Movement penalty for remaining stationary\n    stationary_vector = torch.norm(velocity, p=2, dim=-1)\n    no_movement_penalty = -torch.exp(-stationary_vector / movement_penalty_temp)  # Enhanced penalty\n\n    # Total reward combines all beneficial components\n    total_reward = (torch.exp(speed_reward / speed_temp) +\n                    torch.exp(alignment_reward / alignment_temp) +\n                    target_reach_reward +\n                    no_movement_penalty)\n\n    # Create a rewards dictionary\n    reward_components = {\n        'speed_reward': torch.exp(speed_reward / speed_temp),\n        'alignment_reward': torch.exp(alignment_reward / alignment_temp),\n        'target_reach_reward': target_reach_reward,\n        'movement_penalty': no_movement_penalty\n    }\n    \n    return total_reward, reward_components\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n1. **Rewritten Target Reach Reward**: The target reach reward now provides a strong positive signal based on the inverse distance to the target, encouraging the agent to approach it effectively.\n2. **Rescaled Speed Reward**: The speed reward is capped to a maximum of 1.0, normalizing its impact to avoid overshadowing other components.\n3. **Improved Alignment Reward**: This reward is now aimed at evaluating how well the agent is heading towards the target, rather than strictly relying on speed. \n4. **Increased Movement Penalty**: The penalty for remaining stationary is more pronounced, helping to ensure the agent continually seeks to move.\n5. **Utilization of Exponential Transformations**: Exponential transformations have been used, with their respective temperature parameters, on reward components to help focus the learning on variations.\n\nWith this new reward function, we aim to provide a more relevant and dynamic learning signal that will better guide the RL agent toward mastering the task of running forward on a tilted plane."
