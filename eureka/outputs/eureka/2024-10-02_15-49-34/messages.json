        "content": "Based on the provided policy feedback, we should analyze each component individually:\n\n1. **Distance Reward**:\n   - Values are consistently close to -1000. This indicates that the agent is unable to get closer to the target or that the distance is not effectively being optimized.\n   - This component needs to be rewritten or transformed. We could consider making the reward more sensitive to improvements by clamping the distance or changing the scaling.\n\n2. **Forward Speed Reward**:\n   - The values vary more significantly, with a maximum of about 1.12. However, this may still not provide enough encouragement for the agent to move forward quickly.\n   - As the scale can go both positive and negative, we could take the absolute value for a larger positive reward and perhaps adjust the temperature parameter.\n\n3. **Task Score**:\n   - The maximum value is near 0.83, but the mean is relatively low. This indicates variability but may not be effectively incentivizing the overall task success.\n   - We could enhance this score by combining it in a more rewarding manner with distance and speed metrics.\n\n4. **Episode Lengths**:\n   - With a maximum episode length of around 16, and a mean around 12.64, this does not reflect major successes in completing the task quickly.\n   - This metric does not need to be directly reflected in the reward but could help us design the rewards focusing on shorter, more effective episodes.\n\n### Revised Reward Function:\n\nTo improve the reward function, we'll:\n- Transform the distance reward to be more sensitive to changes by taking its negative and applying an exponential scale.\n- Use the absolute forward speed to create a more consistent, positive reward.\n- Combine these components for a more holistic measure to encourage the agent to make progress.\n\nHere's the revised reward function:\n\n```python\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, dt: float) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Extract torso position and velocity\n    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]  # Shape: (batch_size, 3)\n    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]  # Shape: (batch_size, 3)\n\n    # Compute distance to the target\n    to_target = targets - torso_position\n    distance = torch.norm(to_target, p=2, dim=-1)  # Distance to target\n\n    # Reward for minimizing distance to target (encouraging moving forward)\n    distance_reward = -distance\n\n    # Reward for forward speed (absolute value of x component of velocity)\n    forward_speed_reward = torch.abs(velocity[:, 0])  # Absolute forward x speed\n\n    # Combined reward for progress towards target and speed\n    total_reward = distance_reward + forward_speed_reward\n\n    # Temperature parameters\n    temp_distance = 2.0  # Tuned for more sensitivity\n    temp_speed = 1.0     # Tuned for larger absolute reward scaling\n    \n    # Apply temperature scaling\n    distance_reward_transformed = torch.exp(distance_reward / temp_distance)\n    forward_speed_reward_transformed = torch.exp(forward_speed_reward / temp_speed)\n\n    # Total reward after transformation\n    total_reward_transformed = distance_reward_transformed + forward_speed_reward_transformed\n\n    # Create reward components dictionary\n    reward_components = {\n        'distance_reward': distance_reward,\n        'forward_speed_reward': forward_speed_reward\n    }\n    \n    return total_reward_transformed, reward_components\n``` \n\nThis revised function aims to maximize responsiveness to the actions of the agent by scaling and combining the rewards for distance and speed effectively, addressing previous issues observed in the training feedback."
