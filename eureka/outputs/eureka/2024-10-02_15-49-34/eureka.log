We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 500 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

[2024-10-02 16:51:10,856][root][INFO] - Iteration 4: GPT Output Content:
Based on the provided policy feedback, we should analyze each component individually:

1. **Distance Reward**:
   - Values are consistently close to -1000. This indicates that the agent is unable to get closer to the target or that the distance is not effectively being optimized.
   - This component needs to be rewritten or transformed. We could consider making the reward more sensitive to improvements by clamping the distance or changing the scaling.

2. **Forward Speed Reward**:
   - The values vary more significantly, with a maximum of about 1.12. However, this may still not provide enough encouragement for the agent to move forward quickly.
   - As the scale can go both positive and negative, we could take the absolute value for a larger positive reward and perhaps adjust the temperature parameter.

3. **Task Score**:
   - The maximum value is near 0.83, but the mean is relatively low. This indicates variability but may not be effectively incentivizing the overall task success.
   - We could enhance this score by combining it in a more rewarding manner with distance and speed metrics.

4. **Episode Lengths**:
   - With a maximum episode length of around 16, and a mean around 12.64, this does not reflect major successes in completing the task quickly.
   - This metric does not need to be directly reflected in the reward but could help us design the rewards focusing on shorter, more effective episodes.

### Revised Reward Function:

To improve the reward function, we'll:
- Transform the distance reward to be more sensitive to changes by taking its negative and applying an exponential scale.
- Use the absolute forward speed to create a more consistent, positive reward.
- Combine these components for a more holistic measure to encourage the agent to make progress.

Here's the revised reward function:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, dt: float) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract torso position and velocity
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]  # Shape: (batch_size, 3)
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]  # Shape: (batch_size, 3)

    # Compute distance to the target
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    distance = torch.norm(to_target, p=2, dim=-1)  # Distance to target

    # Reward for minimizing distance to target (encouraging moving forward)
    distance_reward = -distance

    # Reward for forward speed (absolute value of x component of velocity)
    forward_speed_reward = torch.abs(velocity[:, 0])  # Absolute forward x speed

    # Combined reward for progress towards target and speed
    total_reward = distance_reward + forward_speed_reward

    # Temperature parameters
    temp_distance = 2.0  # Tuned for more sensitivity
    temp_speed = 1.0     # Tuned for larger absolute reward scaling
    
    # Apply temperature scaling
    distance_reward_transformed = torch.exp(distance_reward / temp_distance)
    forward_speed_reward_transformed = torch.exp(forward_speed_reward / temp_speed)

    # Total reward after transformation
    total_reward_transformed = distance_reward_transformed + forward_speed_reward_transformed

    # Create reward components dictionary
    reward_components = {
        'distance_reward': distance_reward,
        'forward_speed_reward': forward_speed_reward
    }
    
    return total_reward_transformed, reward_components
``` 

This revised function aims to maximize responsiveness to the actions of the agent by scaling and combining the rewards for distance and speed effectively, addressing previous issues observed in the training feedback.

Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
