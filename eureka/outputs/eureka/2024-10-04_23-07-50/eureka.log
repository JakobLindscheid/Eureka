Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Based on the analysis of the policy feedback:

1. **Stability Reward**: The values for the stability reward are consistently high (average of 0.97) and only slightly vary, indicating that this component is likely saturated and not effectively guiding the learning process. To improve this, we may consider modifying the temperature and introducing a distinction between when the ball is just above the tabletop and when it is far away from it, thus providing a more granular reward signal.

2. **Speed Penalty**: The speed penalty has significant variation (mean of 0.54) and a max value of 0.70. This suggests that while it's helping the learning, it may need to be amplified to ensure the agent learns that moving too quickly is undesirable. We could scale it differently to emphasize reducing speed.

3. **Position Reward**: This component has a mean of 0.99, showing that the majority of actions are leading to a positional alignment near optimal. As with stability reward, fine-tuning the temperature parameter would help introduce some variability that could guide the policy better.

After considering these components, here is a revised reward function that aims to provide the agent with better learning signals:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(ball_positions: torch.Tensor, ball_linvels: torch.Tensor, dof_positions: torch.Tensor, dof_velocities: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Define temperature parameters for reward components
    stability_temp = 0.5  # Increased sensitivity to distance from tabletop
    speed_temp = 2.0      # More significant penalty for speed
    position_temp = 0.5   # Balance for position reward

    # Calculate the vertical distance of the ball relative to the tabletop
    tabletop_height = 0.0
    ball_height = ball_positions[..., 1]  # Assuming y is the second dimension
    distance_from_tabletop = tabletop_height - ball_height

    # Reformulated stability reward with added penalties if the ball falls too low
    stability_reward = torch.exp(stability_temp * torch.clamp(distance_from_tabletop, min=-1.0, max=0.0))  # Less reward for falling
    
    # Amplified speed penalty
    speed_penalty = torch.exp(-speed_temp * torch.norm(ball_linvels, dim=-1)).clamp(max=1.0)
    
    # Reformulated position reward focusing on deviation from desired positions
    ideal_dof_positions = torch.zeros_like(dof_positions[..., :3])  # Assuming desired position is zero
    position_diff = torch.norm(dof_positions[..., :3] - ideal_dof_positions, dim=-1)
    position_reward = torch.exp(position_temp * (1.0 - position_diff)).clamp(max=1.0)  # Focus on minimizing this distance
    
    # Total reward combines all components
    total_reward = stability_reward + speed_penalty + position_reward

    # Prepare individual components for logging or debugging
    reward_components = {
        'stability_reward': stability_reward,
        'speed_penalty': speed_penalty,
        'position_reward': position_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
``` 

In this version:
- The stability reward has been adjusted to provide a reward that clearly differentiates when the ball is too low.
- The speed penalty is amplified to ensure the agent understands that faster movements are less desirable. 
- The position reward is reworked to explicitly encourage moving towards a zero position for degrees of freedom, modifying both the temperature scale and the calculation itself to reflect this aim.
