The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.).

        "content": "### Analysis of Policy Feedback\n\n1. **Upright Reward**:\n   - Values are consistently high (Max: 1.00, Mean: 0.99, Min: 0.96).\n   - This indicates that the pole is mostly upright, which is good. However, the reward is near identical throughout, suggesting that RL is not optimizing this component effectively.\n   - **Action**: Keep the component but consider adjusting the temperature parameter to make it more sensitive to small changes in pole angle.\n\n2. **Velocity Penalty**:\n   - Values vary more (Max: 0.99, Mean: 0.96, Min: 0.80).\n   - This indicates that the cart's velocity is not consistently controlled, which is problematic.\n   - **Action**: Adjust the temperature parameter to make the penalty more sensitive to cart velocity.\n\n3. **Angular Velocity Penalty**:\n   - Values vary more (Max: 0.99, Mean: 0.97, Min: 0.79).\n   - This indicates that the pole's angular velocity is not consistently controlled, which is problematic.\n   - **Action**: Adjust the temperature parameter to make the penalty more sensitive to pole angular velocity.\n\n4. **Task Score**:\n   - Values are inconsistent (Max: 499.00, Mean: 202.52, Min: 0.00).\n   - This indicates that the policy is not consistently solving the task.\n   - **Action**: The task score is not directly influenced by the reward function, but the reward function should be designed to encourage longer episode lengths and higher success rates.\n\n5. **Episode Lengths**:\n   - Values vary significantly (Max: 500.00, Mean: 332.47, Min: 15.14).\n   - This indicates that the policy is not consistently balancing the pole for long durations.\n   - **Action**: The reward function should be designed to encourage longer episode lengths.\n\n### Improved Reward Function\n\nGiven the analysis, we will:\n1. Adjust the temperature parameters for the upright reward, velocity penalty, and angular velocity penalty to make them more sensitive.\n2. Introduce a small penalty for the pole's angular velocity to encourage smoother pole movement.\n3. Ensure the total reward is normalized to a fixed range.\n\n```python\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(dof_pos: torch.Tensor, dof_vel: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Parameters for reward transformation\n    upright_temperature: float = 0.1\n    velocity_temperature: float = 0.1\n    angular_velocity_temperature: float = 0.1\n\n    # Extract the positions and velocities of the cart and the pole\n    cart_pos = dof_pos[:, 0]\n    pole_angle = dof_pos[:, 1]\n    cart_vel = dof_vel[:, 0]\n    pole_vel = dof_vel[:, 1]\n\n    # Reward for keeping the pole upright (closer to 0 radians)\n    upright_reward = torch.exp(-upright_temperature * torch.abs(pole_angle))\n\n    # Penalty for large cart velocities (to keep the cart stable)\n    velocity_penalty = torch.exp(-velocity_temperature * torch.abs(cart_vel))\n\n    # Penalty for large pole angular velocities (to encourage smoother movement)\n    angular_velocity_penalty = torch.exp(-angular_velocity_temperature * torch.abs(pole_vel))\n\n    # Total reward is a combination of upright reward and penalties\n    total_reward = upright_reward * velocity_penalty * angular_velocity_penalty\n\n    # Dictionary of individual reward components\n    reward_components = {\n        \"upright_reward\": upright_reward,\n        \"velocity_penalty\": velocity_penalty,\n        \"angular_velocity_penalty\": angular_velocity_penalty\n    }\n\n    return total_reward, reward_components\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Upright Reward**: Adjusted the temperature parameter to `0.1` to make the reward more sensitive to small changes in the pole angle.\n2. **Velocity Penalty**: Adjusted the temperature parameter to `0.1` to make the penalty more sensitive to cart velocity.\n3. **Angular Velocity Penalty**: Adjusted the temperature parameter to `0.1` to make the penalty more sensitive to pole angular velocity.\n4. **Total Reward**: The total reward is a combination of the upright reward and the two penalties, ensuring that the agent is encouraged to keep the pole upright, control the cart's velocity, and maintain smooth pole movement."

Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:\n    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function\n    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider\n        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter\n        (b) Re-writing the reward component \n        (c) Discarding the reward component\n    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range\nPlease analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code.
