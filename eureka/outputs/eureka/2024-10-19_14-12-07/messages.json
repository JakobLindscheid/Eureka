As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.\n"

        "content": "Upon analyzing the feedback from the RL policy training, the following observations can be made regarding the reward function components:\n\n1. **Speed Reward**:\n   - The values for the speed reward component are relatively close to each other, indicating that the agent may have reached a plateau in optimizing this part of the reward. It means that simply rewarding forward speed may not be sufficient for the RL agent fully explore and optimize its actions for speed.\n\n2. **Action Penalty**:\n   - The action penalty shows a gradual increase, which indicates some learning, but it also suggests that the penalty may not be strong enough to effectively discourage unnecessary movements. Higher penalties could encourage the agent to focus its actions on running straight forward rather than deviating.\n\n3. **Overall Task Score**:\n   - The task score shows some variability, suggesting that the combination of speed and action penalties could be leading to different performance levels. However, the values are below 2, indicating that the performance could be improved.\n\n4. **Episode Lengths**:\n   - The episode lengths vary significantly, with some episodes being very short. This suggests that the agent may be getting stuck or failing to run efficiently in certain conditions, which could point towards the formulation of the reward not providing enough differentiation for good and bad strategies.\n\n### Improvement Strategy\n- **Modify Speed Reward**: Instead of only considering the forward speed, consider the overall magnitude of the velocity to reward both speed and direction.\n- **Increase Action Penalty**: Take the square of the action norm to penalize excessive action use more heavily.\n- **Add a Forward Direction Bonus**: Include a component that specifically rewards the agent for moving in the positive x-direction, which corresponds to forward movement.\n\nHere's the revised reward function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Tuple, Dict\n\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, actions: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Extract necessary components from root_states\n    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]  # Get the velocity of the torso\n    speed = torch.norm(velocity, p=2, dim=-1)  # Magnitude of speed\n    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]  # Only take the forward (x) component of velocity\n\n    # Reward components\n    speed_reward = speed  # Reward proportional to overall speed\n    direction_bonus = torch.clamp(forward_velocity, min=0)  # Reward for moving forward\n    action_penalty = -torch.norm(actions, p=2, dim=-1) ** 2  # Squared penalty to discourage too much action usage\n\n    # Temperature parameters (for reward normalization)\n    speed_temp = 0.05  # Temperature for speed reward\n    direction_temp = 0.1  # Temperature for direction bonus\n    action_temp = 0.05  # Temperature for action penalty\n\n    # Transformed rewards\n    transformed_speed_reward = torch.exp(speed_temp * speed_reward)  # Normalizing speed reward\n    transformed_direction_bonus = torch.exp(direction_temp * direction_bonus)  # Normalizing direction bonus\n    transformed_action_penalty = torch.exp(action_temp * action_penalty)  # Normalizing action penalty\n\n    # Total reward\n    total_reward = transformed_speed_reward + transformed_direction_bonus + transformed_action_penalty\n\n    # Create dictionary of individual components\n    reward_components = {\n        'speed_reward': transformed_speed_reward,\n        'direction_bonus': transformed_direction_bonus,\n        'action_penalty': transformed_action_penalty\n    }\n\n    return total_reward, reward_components\n``` \n\nIn this revised reward function, we:\n1. Reward the overall speed instead of just the forward speed.\n2. Introduced a bonus for moving positively along the x-axis (forward).\n3. Squared the action penalty to increase its impact and encourage efficiency in action.\n4. Adjusted temperature parameters for better scaling of each component's reward. \n\nThese changes should help the agent learn to run more effectively and efficiently within the environment."
