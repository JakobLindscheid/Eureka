We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 200 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
speed_reward: ['1.00', '1.03', '1.10', '1.12', '1.13', '1.12', '1.16', '1.14', '1.17', '1.16'], Max: 1.19, Mean: 1.12, Min: 1.00

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Upon analyzing the feedback from the RL policy training, the following observations can be made regarding the reward function components:

1. **Speed Reward**:
   - The values for the speed reward component are relatively close to each other, indicating that the agent may have reached a plateau in optimizing this part of the reward. It means that simply rewarding forward speed may not be sufficient for the RL agent fully explore and optimize its actions for speed.

2. **Action Penalty**:
   - The action penalty shows a gradual increase, which indicates some learning, but it also suggests that the penalty may not be strong enough to effectively discourage unnecessary movements. Higher penalties could encourage the agent to focus its actions on running straight forward rather than deviating.

3. **Overall Task Score**:
   - The task score shows some variability, suggesting that the combination of speed and action penalties could be leading to different performance levels. However, the values are below 2, indicating that the performance could be improved.

4. **Episode Lengths**:
   - The episode lengths vary significantly, with some episodes being very short. This suggests that the agent may be getting stuck or failing to run efficiently in certain conditions, which could point towards the formulation of the reward not providing enough differentiation for good and bad strategies.

### Improvement Strategy
- **Modify Speed Reward**: Instead of only considering the forward speed, consider the overall magnitude of the velocity to reward both speed and direction.
- **Increase Action Penalty**: Take the square of the action norm to penalize excessive action use more heavily.
- **Add a Forward Direction Bonus**: Include a component that specifically rewards the agent for moving in the positive x-direction, which corresponds to forward movement.

Here's the revised reward function:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, actions: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract necessary components from root_states
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]  # Get the velocity of the torso
    speed = torch.norm(velocity, p=2, dim=-1)  # Magnitude of speed
    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]  # Only take the forward (x) component of velocity

    # Reward components
    speed_reward = speed  # Reward proportional to overall speed
    direction_bonus = torch.clamp(forward_velocity, min=0)  # Reward for moving forward
    action_penalty = -torch.norm(actions, p=2, dim=-1) ** 2  # Squared penalty to discourage too much action usage

    # Temperature parameters (for reward normalization)
    speed_temp = 0.05  # Temperature for speed reward
    direction_temp = 0.1  # Temperature for direction bonus
    action_temp = 0.05  # Temperature for action penalty

    # Transformed rewards
    transformed_speed_reward = torch.exp(speed_temp * speed_reward)  # Normalizing speed reward
    transformed_direction_bonus = torch.exp(direction_temp * direction_bonus)  # Normalizing direction bonus
    transformed_action_penalty = torch.exp(action_temp * action_penalty)  # Normalizing action penalty

    # Total reward
    total_reward = transformed_speed_reward + transformed_direction_bonus + transformed_action_penalty

    # Create dictionary of individual components
    reward_components = {
        'speed_reward': transformed_speed_reward,
        'direction_bonus': transformed_direction_bonus,
        'action_penalty': transformed_action_penalty
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
``` 

In this revised reward function, we:
1. Reward the overall speed instead of just the forward speed.
2. Introduced a bonus for moving positively along the x-axis (forward).
3. Squared the action penalty to increase its impact and encourage efficiency in action.
4. Adjusted temperature parameters for better scaling of each component's reward. 

These changes should help the agent learn to run more effectively and efficiently within the environment.
