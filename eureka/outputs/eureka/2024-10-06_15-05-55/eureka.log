Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Upon analyzing the feedback from the trained reinforcement learning (RL) policy, the following observations can be made:

1. **Speed Reward**:
   - The speed reward has an exceedingly high maximum value (3.59e+15) and a large mean value, indicating that the component may not be well-scaled for effective training. Its exponential nature could be leading to large values that dominate the total reward.
   - There are also very high fluctuations in the reward values, with a minimum value significantly lower compared to its surrounding values, indicating inconsistencies.
   
2. **Forward Progress Reward**:
   - This component shows an issue where it does not yield finite values (all recorded values are `'inf'`). This could imply that the calculation results in an undefined behavior, which may stem from using large values without proper scaling.
   - Given that this component isn't providing usable feedback, it needs to be rewritten or replaced.

3. **Task Score**:
   - This component fluctuates around very small negative numbers which don't provide meaningful feedback for the agent's performance. It seems to have minimal contribution towards the task, so we may choose to discard or re-scale this.

4. **Episode Lengths**:
   - The episode lengths seem fairly consistent and within a reasonable range. This may indicate the agent is learning to complete episodes but might not be optimizing towards speed, thus we could adjust the reward function to incentivize longer distances covered as opposed to merely time spent in episode.

**Revised Reward Function**:
To address these observations, we can revamp the reward function with the following components:
- A revised speed reward that measures the normalized speed to prevent extreme values, ensuring that it has a proper range.
- A forward progress reward that computes the distance moved towards the target, providing a finite, measurable quantity.
- Removing the task score component since it doesn’t provide useful information.
- We’ll introduce better scaling and normalize components where necessary.

@torch.jit.script

    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]  # [x, y, z]
    
    # Calculate forward speed (along the x-axis for running)
    forward_speed = torso_velocity[:, 0]  # Only take the x component of velocity
    speed_reward = forward_speed / speed_temp  # Linear scaling of speed

``` 

This revised reward function aims to provide the agent with more meaningful feedback, facilitating a better optimization process during training. The components are scaled appropriately to encourage improvement in the task performance without leading to extreme value fluctuations.

[2024-10-06 19:12:11,566][root][INFO] - Iteration 2: GPT Output Content:
Upon analyzing the provided feedback from the RL policy's training:

1. **Speed Reward**:
   - The range of values for `speed_reward` indicates improvement, with a maximum of **1.45** and a mean of **1.12**. However, there are fluctuations from a minimum of **-0.01**, suggesting that there are times when the speed reward is negative, which could be hindering the overall learning process. 
   - The agent appears to learn this component well, but it could benefit from better scaling. For instance, we could introduce a transformation that promotes more consistent positive values.

2. **Forward Progress Reward**:
   - The values for the `forward_progress_reward` are static, always around **0.02**, with no variance. This indicates that the agent is not learning anything useful from this component, as it appears to provide no meaningful feedback.
   - As this component does not contribute positively toward the rewards or learning, it should be rewritten to measure a more dynamic change in progress or how well the humanoid is moving closer to the target.

3. **Task Score**:
   - The `task_score` feedback shows a wider range, reaching maximums of **7.15** and mean values of **5.56**, indicating it could have a significant effect on the total reward. However, it still has negatives, with a minimum of **-0.05**. 
   - Given that the minimum is quite close to 0 however, and the maximum values are significant, this component might be beneficial to keep, but it needs normalization to avoid negative impacts on the overall reward.

4. **Episode Lengths**:
   - The episode lengths show significant variance indicating the agent is sometimes successfully reaching its goal. The min value of **23.86** shows that there are episodes where the humanoid fails to make progress. This means we need to make sure the reward function encourages longer completion times that correspond to running tasks.

**Revised Reward Function**:
To improve the reward function based on the aforementioned analysis:
- The **Speed Reward** will be transformed using exponential scaling to promote positive rewards.
- The **Forward Progress Reward** will be rewritten to assess actual distance moved towards the target.
- The **Task Score** will be adjusted to ensure it's positively contributing to the total reward.
- Introduce variable scaling to manage the potential influences of each component effectively.

Here's the revised reward function:

This revised reward function is crafted to provide better incentives for the humanoid by focusing on meaningful feedback that scales appropriately, enabling more consistent learning during training. The adjustments should lead to increased task performance over time.

[2024-10-06 19:12:11,566][root][INFO] - Iteration 2: User Content:
We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 300 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
speed_reward: ['-0.00', '4.69', '4.55', '4.81', '4.42', '4.42', '4.13', '4.12', '3.82', '3.70'], Max: 5.17, Mean: 4.14, Min: -0.00 
forward_progress_reward: ['0.02', '0.02', '0.02', '0.02', '0.02', '0.02', '0.02', '0.02', '0.02', '0.02'], Max: 0.02, Mean: 0.02, Min: 0.02 
task_score: ['0.01', '6306.97', '227725024.00', '5455969280.00', '313315328000.00', '86290255052800.00', '2665019867136.00', '169937091952640.00', '3832245125120.00', '13919574016.00'], Max: 2903422905985531904.00, Mean: 1478301593050195.25, Min: 0.01 
task_score: ['-0.05', '2.55', '2.46', '2.44', '2.38', '2.38', '2.33', '2.33', '2.26', '2.24'], Max: 2.65, Mean: 2.32, Min: -0.05 
episode_lengths: ['31.92', '52.17', '52.54', '54.02', '54.91', '56.10', '55.28', '54.97', '54.17', '54.11'], Max: 56.82, Mean: 53.82, Min: 24.73 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
