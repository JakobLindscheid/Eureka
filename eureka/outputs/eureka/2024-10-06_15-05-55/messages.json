As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.\n"

        "content": "Upon analyzing the feedback regarding the individual reward components and the overall policy metrics, we can identify several critical observations and necessary adjustments:\n\n1. **Speed Reward**:\n   - The speed reward shows significant variability, with a maximum of **383.01**, a mean of **130.72**, and a minimum of **0.11**. This indicates that it is being effectively utilized; however, the minimum value suggests that there are episodes where the agent is not optimizing speed efficiently. We need to maintain this component but ensure that it regularly contributes to positive rewards.\n\n2. **Forward Progress Reward**:\n   - This reward component is static at **0.02** across all evaluations. This indicates the RL model is unable to exploit or leverage this component effectively. Consequently, we need to redefine this reward to ensure it assesses how much forward distance the humanoid is covering toward the target.\n\n3. **Task Score**:\n   - The task score exhibits variation but ranges widely from **-0.05** to **7.31**, indicating extreme numbers that can impact the total reward disproportionately. This suggests that it has been growing unregulated. It should be redefined to avoid becoming excessively large or negative, hence balancing it properly.\n\n4. **Overall Episode Lengths**:\n   - The average episode length varies significantly (Max: **309.30**, Min: **24.59**), indicating inconsistencies in performance. A more consistent reward structure may lead to improved mean episode lengths.\n\nGiven these assessments, we will make adjustments to the reward function:\n\n- **Speed Reward**: Maintain with a slight adjustment to ensure it does not drop to zero.\n- **Forward Progress Reward**: Redefine to a more meaningful measure of actual progress toward the target.\n- **Task Score**: Rescale and normalize to prevent excessive contribution to the overall reward.\n\n### Revised Reward Function\n\n```python\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, dt: float) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the reward for the humanoid task focused on running as fast as possible with improved components.\n\n    Inputs:\n    - root_states: Tensor containing the state of the humanoid (position and velocity).\n    - targets: Tensor containing the target position for the humanoid.\n    - dt: Time step for the environment.\n\n    Returns:\n    - reward: Total reward based on the humanoid's speed, progress towards the target, and scaled task score.\n    - reward_components: Dictionary of individual reward components.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define temperature parameters for normalization\n    speed_temp = 20.0  # Temperature for speed normalization\n    forward_progress_temp = 5.0  # Temperature for forward progress normalization\n    task_score_temp = 10.0  # Temperature for task score normalization\n\n    # Extracting torso state\n    torso_velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]  # [vx, vy, vz]\n    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]  # [x, y, z]\n\n    # Calculate forward speed (only in x-axis) and ensure positive reward\n    forward_speed = torso_velocity[:, 0]\n    normalized_speed_reward = torch.clamp(forward_speed, min=0.0)  # Ensure non-negative values\n\n    # Calculate forward progress toward the target in x-axis\n    distance_to_target = targets[:, 0] - torso_position[:, 0]  # x-component only\n    forward_progress_reward = torch.clamp(distance_to_target, min=0.0)  # Capture actual distance covered\n\n    # Normalize forward progress\n    normalized_forward_progress = forward_progress_reward / (torch.norm(distance_to_target) + 1e-5)\n\n    # Normalize task score \n    overall_task_score = normalized_speed_reward + normalized_forward_progress\n    normalized_task_score = torch.clamp(overall_task_score / (task_score_temp + 1e-5), min=0.0, max=1.0)\n\n    # Summing all rewards with respective scaling\n    total_reward = (\n        torch.exp(normalized_speed_reward / speed_temp) + \n        torch.exp(normalized_forward_progress / forward_progress_temp) + \n        normalized_task_score\n    )\n\n    # Creating the reward components dictionary\n    reward_components = {\n        'speed_reward': normalized_speed_reward,\n        'forward_progress_reward': normalized_forward_progress,\n        'task_score': normalized_task_score\n    }\n\n    return total_reward, reward_components\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Adjustments:\n- **Improved Forward Progress**: Directly measures the humanoid's advancement toward the target.\n- **Rescaled Components**: Each reward component has been scaled appropriately to stay within manageable ranges and contribute meaningfully to the overall reward calculation.\n- **Normalized and Clamped Values**: To ensure the rewards remain within a reasonable range, making them more interpretable for the RL algorithm.\n\nThis revised reward function aims to balance the reward components to enhance learning for the RL agent, encouraging it to optimize running speed while making actual progress toward its goals."
