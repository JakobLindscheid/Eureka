As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.).

        "content": "Upon analyzing the provided feedback from the RL policy's training:\n\n1. **Speed Reward**:\n   - The range of values for `speed_reward` indicates improvement, with a maximum of **1.45** and a mean of **1.12**. However, there are fluctuations from a minimum of **-0.01**, suggesting that there are times when the speed reward is negative, which could be hindering the overall learning process. \n   - The agent appears to learn this component well, but it could benefit from better scaling. For instance, we could introduce a transformation that promotes more consistent positive values.\n\n2. **Forward Progress Reward**:\n   - The values for the `forward_progress_reward` are static, always around **0.02**, with no variance. This indicates that the agent is not learning anything useful from this component, as it appears to provide no meaningful feedback.\n   - As this component does not contribute positively toward the rewards or learning, it should be rewritten to measure a more dynamic change in progress or how well the humanoid is moving closer to the target.\n\n3. **Task Score**:\n   - The `task_score` feedback shows a wider range, reaching maximums of **7.15** and mean values of **5.56**, indicating it could have a significant effect on the total reward. However, it still has negatives, with a minimum of **-0.05**. \n   - Given that the minimum is quite close to 0 however, and the maximum values are significant, this component might be beneficial to keep, but it needs normalization to avoid negative impacts on the overall reward.\n\n4. **Episode Lengths**:\n   - The episode lengths show significant variance indicating the agent is sometimes successfully reaching its goal. The min value of **23.86** shows that there are episodes where the humanoid fails to make progress. This means we need to make sure the reward function encourages longer completion times that correspond to running tasks.\n\n**Revised Reward Function**:\nTo improve the reward function based on the aforementioned analysis:\n- The **Speed Reward** will be transformed using exponential scaling to promote positive rewards.\n- The **Forward Progress Reward** will be rewritten to assess actual distance moved towards the target.\n- The **Task Score** will be adjusted to ensure it's positively contributing to the total reward.\n- Introduce variable scaling to manage the potential influences of each component effectively.\n\nHere's the revised reward function:\n\n```python\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, dt: float) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the reward for the humanoid task of running as fast as possible with improved components and scaling.\n\n    Inputs:\n    - root_states: Tensor containing the state of the humanoid (position and velocity).\n    - targets: Tensor containing the target position for the humanoid.\n    - dt: Time step for the environment.\n\n    Returns:\n    - reward: Total reward based on the humanoid's speed, progress towards the target, and task score.\n    - reward_components: Dictionary of individual reward components.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Temperature parameters\n    speed_temp = 2.0  # Temperature for speed normalization\n    task_score_temp = 3.0  # Temperature for task score normalization\n    forward_progress_temp = 5.0  # Temperature for forward progress normalization\n\n    # Extracting the torso velocity and position\n    torso_velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]  # [vx, vy, vz]\n    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]  # [x, y, z]\n\n    # Calculate forward speed (only in x-axis)\n    forward_speed = torso_velocity[:, 0]  \n    normalized_speed_reward = torch.exp(forward_speed / speed_temp) - 1  # Exponential to promote positive learning\n\n    # Calculate forward progress towards the target along the x-axis\n    distance_to_target = targets[:, 0] - torso_position[:, 0]  # x-component only\n    forward_progress_reward = torch.clamp(distance_to_target / (torch.norm(distance_to_target) + 1e-5), min=0.0, max=1.0)\n\n    # Simplified task score calculation\n    task_score = normalized_speed_reward + forward_progress_reward\n    normalized_task_score = torch.exp(task_score / task_score_temp) - 1  \n\n    # Total reward\n    total_reward = normalized_speed_reward + forward_progress_reward + normalized_task_score\n\n    # Creating the reward components dictionary\n    reward_components = {\n        'speed_reward': normalized_speed_reward,\n        'forward_progress_reward': forward_progress_reward,\n        'task_score': normalized_task_score\n    }\n\n    return total_reward, reward_components\n``` \n\nThis revised reward function is crafted to provide better incentives for the humanoid by focusing on meaningful feedback that scales appropriately, enabling more consistent learning during training. The adjustments should lead to increased task performance over time."
