As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.).

        "content": "### Analysis of Policy Feedback\n\n1. **Speed Reward Component**:\n   - The values show some variation, with a Max of 1.51 and a Mean of 0.82. This indicates the agent can achieve speeds but potentially lacks the incentive to push further.\n   - The minimum speed drops to 0.59, which suggests that the agent is experiencing instances of slow movement.\n   - **Recommendation**: We might need to increase the temperature parameter to offer more variability or potentially reconsider how speed is rewarded to encourage even faster movement.\n\n2. **Task Score Component**:\n   - The task score values are very close in range, with a high negative value around -998, indicating that the agent is not making significant progress toward the target.\n   - The lack of variance in this reward component indicates that the implementation may not effectively motivate desirable actions.\n   - **Recommendation**: The current negative distance calculation isn't working well. Reworking and possibly changing how we calculate this score might be better.\n\n3. **Overall Feedback**:\n   - Success rates have been noted as near zero, indicating the policy does not effectively solve the task of running quickly toward the target.\n   - Given the observations, it seems necessary to entirely rewrite the reward function to balance speed and position targeting more effectively.\n\n### New Reward Function Design\n\nIt\u2019s essential to create a more balanced reward that provides meaningful feedback for both speed and proximity to the target:\n\n- **Speed Component**: Keep this rewarded, but possibly employ a squared function to encourage maximization even more.\n- **Distance Component**: Instead of using negative distance, use a reward value that positively reinforces being closer to the target.\n- **Combined Reward**: The combined reward should be more straightforwardly formulated to balance the two components effectively.\n\nHere is the new reward function code:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Tuple, Dict\n\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, dof_vel: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Temperature parameters for normalization\n    speed_temp = 0.3  # Lower temperature to increase reward sensitivity\n    distance_temp = 0.1\n    \n    # Extracting torso velocity (velocity of the humanoid)\n    torso_velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]  # Shape: (N, 3)\n    \n    # Calculate speed (magnitude of the velocity)\n    speed = torch.norm(torso_velocity, p=2, dim=-1)  # (N,)\n    speed_reward = torch.exp(speed / speed_temp)  # Exponential to normalize speed\n    \n    # Calculate distance to target (as positive reward, shorter distance means better)\n    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]  # Shape: (N, 3)\n    to_target = targets - torso_position  # Target vector\n    distance = torch.norm(to_target, p=2, dim=-1)  # (N,)\n    \n    # Reward based on distance (the smaller, the better)\n    distance_reward = torch.exp(-distance / distance_temp)  # Exponentially incentivizing closeness to the target\n\n    # Combined total reward \n    total_reward = speed_reward + distance_reward  # Encourages both speed and proximity\n\n    # Create a dictionary to return individual components for analytics\n    reward_components = {\n        'speed_reward': speed_reward,\n        'distance_reward': distance_reward,\n    }\n    \n    return total_reward.sum(), reward_components  # Return total and individual rewards\n```\n\n### Key Improvements:\n- **Speed Reward**: This now uses an exponential function to ensure higher speeds yield significantly higher rewards.\n- **Distance Reward**: It rewards the agent for being closer to the target rather than penalizing distance, effectively creating a more informative signal.\n- **Balance**: The two components are combined straightforwardly to give the agent clearer and more actionable feedback. This version is expected to guide the agent better to optimize both speed and target reaching effectively."
