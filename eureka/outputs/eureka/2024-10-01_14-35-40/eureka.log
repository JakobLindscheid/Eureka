Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider

    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

In the analysis of the feedback from the existing reward function, we observe the following:

1. **Running Reward**: 
   - The values are mostly around the maximum (1.00), which indicates that the agent is successfully achieving high forward velocity. However, the mean (0.99) suggests that while it achieves high speeds, there is little room for improvement. This component may benefit from an adjustment to promote even faster running speeds or differentiate between varying speeds.
   
2. **Action Penalty**: 
   - The action penalty values vary, indicating that the agent is modifying its actions. However, the mean (0.86) suggests that the penalty isn't significant enough to deter excessive action usage. The maximum value is 0.99, showing that there might be instances of erratic actions that need more penalty.
   
3. **Task Score**: 
   - This component shows a wide range with the mean being very close to zero. It indicates that the task score is not effectively driving the learning process as it may not be contributing positively to the total reward. This component should be modified or discarded.

4. **Episode Lengths**: 
   - The episode lengths vary significantly, with a mean length of 890.13. This suggests that sometimes the agent can maintain its performance over extended periods, while in other episodes, it fails to run efficiently. This variability signifies that the task is not consistently being optimized.

Based on this analysis, we should redefine the reward function with the following adjustments:

- **Running Reward**: Scale the forward velocity reward significantly to encourage higher speeds (this may be accomplished by removing the exponential scaling so that it doesn't saturate).
  
- **Action Penalty**: Introduce a stronger penalty for excessive action costs to encourage smoother movements. A simple squared action norm could work well.
  
- **Removal of Task Score**: Remove this component, as it does not contribute positively to agent's performance.

Here’s the updated reward function code:

```python
from typing import Tuple, Dict
import torch

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, actions: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract the torso's velocity in the x direction
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]  # Assuming the x, y, z velocities are in this slice
    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]  # Forward direction is the x axis
    
    # Reward for running forward: higher speed yields a higher reward
    running_reward = forward_velocity  # Directly use forward velocity to encourage higher speeds
  
    # Penalty for excessive actions (to encourage efficient movement)
    action_penalty = -torch.norm(actions, p=2, dim=-1) ** 2  # Squared penalty for action magnitude
    
    # Normalize rewards to keep overall reward within a fixed range (after summing)
    total_reward = torch.clip(running_reward + action_penalty, min=-10.0, max=10.0)

    # Create reward components dictionary
    reward_components = {
        "running_reward": running_reward,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty
    }
    
    return total_reward, reward_components
``` 

In this revised reward function:
- The running reward directly correlates with forward velocity, maximizing it rather than saturating it.
- The action penalty is more significant due to the squaring, discouraging excessive or erratic movements.
- The elimination of the task score simplifies the overall reward structure, focusing more on achieving high velocities efficiently.

Let's analyze the provided policy feedback for each reward component:

### Analysis of Existing Reward Components

1. **running_reward**:
   - The values fluctuated but did reach a maximum of 9.21 with a mean of 7.16. This indicates that the running reward encourages better velocities but may not fully utilize the maximum potential speeds. The presence of a minimum of -0.03 suggests that there are cases where the agent moves backward or is stationary.
   - As running_speed is crucial for the task, we should recalibrate it to ensure that the agent is incentivized to consistently run forward at optimal speeds. Therefore, we will remove any negative impact by normalizing this reward to always be non-negative.

2. **action_penalty**:
   - The values have a maximum of -0.77 and a mean of -2.27, which indicates that the penalty is significant. However, since penalizing action usage is essential, I recommend scaling this down to lessen its impact on the overall reward. We could normalize it further for better optimization in learning.

3. **task_score**:
   - The task score has similar characteristics to the running reward. With values ranging from -0.03 to a max of 9.02 and a mean of 7.00, it’s clear that this component is contributing positively but should probably be merged with running_reward since both focus on rewarding movement. Given that the task score doesn’t contribute uniquely to the reward breakdown, it can be discarded.

4. **episode_lengths**:
   - While ephemeral, the episode lengths have a mean of 718.26 and show major variability, indicating that learning is occurring but with inconsistent success in running, correlating with the other components. Although there are no specific rewards linked to this metric in the current reward function, it can be indirectly assessed through running_reward.

### Proposed Changes

Given the above analysis, I will rewrite the reward function as follows:

- Normalize `running_reward` to ensure it always reflects positive outcomes, supporting the task of running forward effectively.
- Reduce the intensity of the `action_penalty` to avoid stifling exploration too severely.
- Discard the `task_score` as it overlaps with running_reward.
  
### New Reward Function Code

Here’s the refined reward function code:

```python
from typing import Tuple, Dict
import torch

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, actions: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract the torso's velocity in the x direction
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]  # Assuming the x, y, z velocities are in this slice
    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]  # Forward direction is the x axis

    # Normalize forward velocity to be non-negative
    running_reward = torch.clip(forward_velocity, min=0.0)  # Ensure no negative rewards for backward movement
    
    # Penalty for excessive actions (to encourage efficient movement) with normalization
    action_penalty = -0.5 * (torch.norm(actions, p=2, dim=-1) ** 2)  # Halved penalty

    # Combined total reward
    total_reward = running_reward + action_penalty

    # Create reward components dictionary
    reward_components = {
        "running_reward": running_reward,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty
    }
    
    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Summary of Changes
1. **Normalizes the `running_reward`** to prevent negative contributions.
2. **Reduces the `action_penalty`** to allow more exploration while enforcing efficiency without overwhelming penalty.
3. **Removes `task_score`** entirely, streamlining the reward structure.
4. Focuses solely on achieving forward movement efficiently. 

This new reward function should lead to better enhancement of the agent's policies towards accomplishing the task of running forward effectively.

[2024-10-01 19:08:17,135][root][INFO] - Iteration 2: User Content:
We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 500 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
running_reward: ['0.29', '6.71', '8.02', '8.32', '8.86', '9.22', '9.47', '9.46', '9.53', '9.74'], Max: 10.22, Mean: 8.51, Min: 0.29 
action_penalty: ['-2.08', '-0.84', '-0.98', '-1.01', '-1.04', '-1.05', '-1.09', '-1.10', '-1.12', '-1.12'], Max: -0.47, Mean: -1.03, Min: -2.08 
task_score: ['0.01', '6.71', '8.01', '8.30', '8.85', '9.21', '9.46', '9.45', '9.51', '9.72'], Max: 10.21, Mean: 8.49, Min: -0.01 
episode_lengths: ['45.50', '904.78', '901.50', '888.57', '927.89', '926.75', '931.72', '939.21', '920.90', '925.85'], Max: 969.86, Mean: 882.98, Min: 45.50 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

[2024-10-01 21:11:41,862][root][INFO] - Iteration 3: GPT Output Content:
Let's analyze the provided RL policy feedback for each reward component based on the given data and make adjustments to the reward function to better optimize the task of making the ant run forward as fast as possible.

### Analysis of Existing Reward Components

1. **running_reward**:
   - **Values**: The maximum value reached was 10.22, with a mean of 8.51 and a minimum of 0.29. This component shows a promising upward trend, indicating that the agent is learning to run forward, but the minimum value suggests it can still occasionally perform poorly.
   - **Conclusion**: We can keep this reward component; however, we might introduce a temperature variable to further optimize its scaling.

2. **action_penalty**:
   - **Values**: The action penalty ranges from -2.08 to about -0.47, with a mean of -1.03. This indicates it affects the overall performance negatively, given that its values are consistently negative and not significantly improving.
   - **Conclusion**: This penalty is not being effectively optimized, so we should consider changing its scale and potentially its structure to reduce its negative impact while still encouraging efficient actions.

3. **task_score**:
   - **Values**: The task score exhibited a similar range (max of 10.21, mean of 8.49, min of -0.01) to running_reward. This indicates potential redundancy because it does not provide distinctly different feedback than running_reward.
   - **Conclusion**: Since task_score overlaps with running_reward, we should discard it to simplify the reward structure.

4. **episode_lengths**:
   - **Values**: The maximum episode length is noted at 969.86, but what matters more is that the mean is relatively high (882.98), indicating that the agent is completing relatively lengthy episodes. The focus here should remain on task performance rather than continual episode length.
   - **Conclusion**: This metric alone does not influence the reward computation directly, so we will not include it in our reward function output. If we redesign the rewards correctly, episode lengths should ideally improve as a byproduct.

### Proposed Improvements to the Reward Function

Given this analysis, we will adjust the reward function as follows:

- Retain **running_reward** while introducing a temperature parameter to normalize its contributions.
- Reconfigure **action_penalty** to incentivize efficiency more subtly.
- Discard **task_score** as it does not add value.
  
### New Reward Function Code

Here’s the revised reward function code:

```python
from typing import Tuple, Dict
import torch

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, actions: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract torso's velocity in the x direction
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]  # Assuming the x, y, z velocities are in this slice
    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]  # Forward movement is along the x-axis
    
    # Temperature parameters for scaling
    running_temp = 0.1
    action_temp = 0.05

    # Calculate normalized running reward
    running_reward = torch.exp(forward_velocity * running_temp) - 1  # Normalized to be non-negative

    # Calculate action penalty with reduction
    action_penalty = -0.1 * (torch.norm(actions, p=2, dim=-1) ** 2)  # Modified penalty factor

    # Combined total reward
    total_reward = running_reward + action_penalty

    # Create reward components dictionary
    reward_components = {
        "running_reward": running_reward,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty
    }
    
    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Key Changes
1. **Running Reward Scaling**: Reduced through an exponential mapping with a temperature variable `running_temp` to better capture forward movement while ensuring it stays in a positive domain.
2. **Action Penalty**: Altered its impact (reduced scaling factor) to allow more flexibility and less negative effect on the overall reward while still discouraging unnecessary movement.
3. **Removal of Task Score**: Streamlined the function to focus solely on meaningful components.

This newly structured reward function should help the ant learn to run forward more effectively while also efficiently managing actions.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 500 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
running_reward: ['0.00', '0.91', '1.29', '1.46', '1.66', '1.63', '1.64', '1.76', '1.68', '1.68'], Max: 1.91, Mean: 1.43, Min: 0.00 
action_penalty: ['-0.42', '-0.10', '-0.11', '-0.13', '-0.11', '-0.12', '-0.11', '-0.12', '-0.11', '-0.12'], Max: -0.07, Mean: -0.11, Min: -0.42 
task_score: ['0.01', '6.22', '7.95', '8.55', '9.45', '9.21', '9.26', '9.74', '9.45', '9.24'], Max: 10.28, Mean: 8.31, Min: -0.00 
episode_lengths: ['46.00', '808.10', '892.73', '866.02', '933.55', '926.33', '920.09', '945.32', '950.20', '840.68'], Max: 978.45, Mean: 870.77, Min: 44.11 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Let's perform a detailed analysis of the feedback from the training of the reinforcement learning policy based on the provided metrics for each reward component.

### 1. **Running Reward Analysis**
- **Values Observed**:
  - Max: 1.91, Mean: 1.43, Min: 0.00
- **Analysis**: Although the values improved over time, the maximum value is still relatively low, indicating limited performance. The fact that this value has a minimum of 0.00 suggests that it still feels the absence of incentive during certain training instances.
- **Recommendations**: 
  - We should consider increasing the sensitivity of this reward to running speed to improve its impact. We can adjust the exponential's temperature parameter to achieve this goal effectively.

### 2. **Action Penalty Analysis**
- **Values Observed**:
  - Max: -0.07, Mean: -0.11, Min: -0.42
- **Analysis**: The penalty values are negative (hence reducing overall reward), indicating that it is perhaps too strict. The maximum value is slightly improving while still being negative, suggesting that it may be pulling the reward down unnecessarily.
- **Recommendations**:
  - We can modify this penalty to be less severe. Additionally, we may want to introduce a variable scaling factor that would allow for a reduced negative impact.

### 3. **Task Score Analysis**
- **Values Observed**:
  - Max: 10.28, Mean: 8.31, Min: 0.00
- **Analysis**: The task score presents a reasonable range. However, this component seems quite similar to the running_reward, and there's also an observable floor at 0.00, raising concerns about its utility.
- **Recommendations**:
  - As task_score is similar to the running reward and has redundancy in what it measures, we will discard this component in favor of refining the running reward instead.

### 4. **Episode Lengths Analysis**
- **Values Observed**:
  - Max: 978.45, Mean: 870.77, Min: 44.11
- **Analysis**: The episode lengths fluctuate widely. Longer episode lengths indicate better performance overall, but this does not necessarily correlate with optimal behavior toward the running task.
- **Conclusion**: We will not directly include episode lengths in the reward function, as it is more useful to address task performance more directly through other components.

### New Reward Function Design

Given the analysis, we will focus on refining the running reward and the action penalty components. The new reward function will implement adjustments to enhance the sensitivity of speed-based rewards while softening action penalties.

### Revised Reward Function Code

Here’s the rewritten reward function code based on our analysis:

```python
from typing import Tuple, Dict
import torch

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, actions: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract torso's velocity in the x direction
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]  # Assuming the x, y, z velocities are in this slice
    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]  # Forward movement is along the x-axis
    
    # Temperature parameters for scaling
    running_temp = 0.05  # Adjusted for more sensitivity
    action_temp = 0.02   # A softer penalty

    # Calculate normalized running reward (more responsive to speed)
    running_reward = torch.exp(forward_velocity * running_temp) - 1  # Ensure positive contribution

    # Calculate action penalty with reduced negative impact
    action_penalty = -0.02 * (torch.norm(actions, p=2, dim=-1) ** 2)  # Reduced scaling factor

    # Combined total reward 
    total_reward = running_reward + action_penalty

    # Create reward components dictionary
    reward_components = {
        "running_reward": running_reward,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty
    }
    
    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Key Changes Implemented:
1. **Increased Sensitivity in Running Reward**: Adjusted temperature for running_temp to 0.05 to better incentivize forward velocity.
2. **Milder Action Penalty**: Changed the action penalty's scaling factor to -0.02 to provide a softer influence, incentivizing more efficient action use without excessively penalizing the agent.
3. **Eliminated Task Score**: Removed redundancy and cleaned the function for focus on performance.

With these improvements, we hope to enhance the agent's ability to learn to run forward effectively while managing actions more efficiently.
