As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.).

        "content": "Let's perform a detailed analysis of the feedback from the training of the reinforcement learning policy based on the provided metrics for each reward component.\n\n### 1. **Running Reward Analysis**\n- **Values Observed**:\n  - Max: 1.91, Mean: 1.43, Min: 0.00\n- **Analysis**: Although the values improved over time, the maximum value is still relatively low, indicating limited performance. The fact that this value has a minimum of 0.00 suggests that it still feels the absence of incentive during certain training instances.\n- **Recommendations**: \n  - We should consider increasing the sensitivity of this reward to running speed to improve its impact. We can adjust the exponential's temperature parameter to achieve this goal effectively.\n\n### 2. **Action Penalty Analysis**\n- **Values Observed**:\n  - Max: -0.07, Mean: -0.11, Min: -0.42\n- **Analysis**: The penalty values are negative (hence reducing overall reward), indicating that it is perhaps too strict. The maximum value is slightly improving while still being negative, suggesting that it may be pulling the reward down unnecessarily.\n- **Recommendations**:\n  - We can modify this penalty to be less severe. Additionally, we may want to introduce a variable scaling factor that would allow for a reduced negative impact.\n\n### 3. **Task Score Analysis**\n- **Values Observed**:\n  - Max: 10.28, Mean: 8.31, Min: 0.00\n- **Analysis**: The task score presents a reasonable range. However, this component seems quite similar to the running_reward, and there's also an observable floor at 0.00, raising concerns about its utility.\n- **Recommendations**:\n  - As task_score is similar to the running reward and has redundancy in what it measures, we will discard this component in favor of refining the running reward instead.\n\n### 4. **Episode Lengths Analysis**\n- **Values Observed**:\n  - Max: 978.45, Mean: 870.77, Min: 44.11\n- **Analysis**: The episode lengths fluctuate widely. Longer episode lengths indicate better performance overall, but this does not necessarily correlate with optimal behavior toward the running task.\n- **Conclusion**: We will not directly include episode lengths in the reward function, as it is more useful to address task performance more directly through other components.\n\n### New Reward Function Design\n\nGiven the analysis, we will focus on refining the running reward and the action penalty components. The new reward function will implement adjustments to enhance the sensitivity of speed-based rewards while softening action penalties.\n\n### Revised Reward Function Code\n\nHere\u2019s the rewritten reward function code based on our analysis:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Tuple, Dict\nimport torch\n\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, actions: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Extract torso's velocity in the x direction\n    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]  # Assuming the x, y, z velocities are in this slice\n    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]  # Forward movement is along the x-axis\n    \n    # Temperature parameters for scaling\n    running_temp = 0.05  # Adjusted for more sensitivity\n    action_temp = 0.02   # A softer penalty\n\n    # Calculate normalized running reward (more responsive to speed)\n    running_reward = torch.exp(forward_velocity * running_temp) - 1  # Ensure positive contribution\n\n    # Calculate action penalty with reduced negative impact\n    action_penalty = -0.02 * (torch.norm(actions, p=2, dim=-1) ** 2)  # Reduced scaling factor\n\n    # Combined total reward \n    total_reward = running_reward + action_penalty\n\n    # Create reward components dictionary\n    reward_components = {\n        \"running_reward\": running_reward,\n        \"action_penalty\": action_penalty\n    }\n    \n    return total_reward, reward_components\n```\n\n### Key Changes Implemented:\n1. **Increased Sensitivity in Running Reward**: Adjusted temperature for running_temp to 0.05 to better incentivize forward velocity.\n2. **Milder Action Penalty**: Changed the action penalty's scaling factor to -0.02 to provide a softer influence, incentivizing more efficient action use without excessively penalizing the agent.\n3. **Eliminated Task Score**: Removed redundancy and cleaned the function for focus on performance.\n\nWith these improvements, we hope to enhance the agent's ability to learn to run forward effectively while managing actions more efficiently."
