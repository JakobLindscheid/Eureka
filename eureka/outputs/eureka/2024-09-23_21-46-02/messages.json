As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.).

        "content": "Let's carefully analyze the provided feedback on the reward components:\n\n### Reward Component Analysis\n\n1. **Position Reward**:\n   - **Values**: The max (0.90) and mean (0.61) suggest that the quadcopter is sometimes close to the target, but a minimum of 0.00 indicates that it is often far away.\n   - **Recommendations**: The position reward needs to be made more sensitive and consistent. We can change the scale and introduce a more informative reward structure that emphasizes proximity to the target.\n   - **Action**: Revise the position reward formula and balance around a target distance.\n\n2. **Velocity Reward**:\n   - **Values**: It consistently returns values close to 1.00. The mean is 0.99 with a minimum of 0.98 indicating that it is not effectively optimized anymore.\n   - **Recommendations**: Consider scaling down the velocity reward or adjusting the penalty to further fine-tune the learning process since it appears to be saturating.\n   - **Action**: We can re-design this component to offer a greater penalty for higher velocities that are undesirable for hovering.\n\n3. **Task Score Reward**:\n   - **Values**: The max (1.97) and mean (1.56) are relatively high, but the minimum being at 0.00 suggests that it is often not rewarded for being within range of the target.\n   - **Recommendations**: This component is important but needs more scrutiny on how we penalize being away from the target. The presence of negative task scores was troubling, indicating the negative penalties might be too harsh.\n   - **Action**: We should consider re-scaling to promote consistent hovering and modify the conditions under which the reward is diminished.\n\n4. **General Episode Lengths**:\n   - **Values**: The range of episode lengths indicates potential inefficiency. The large maximum episode length (499) along with a mean length (478) suggests that the quadcopter might be struggling to learn effectively.\n   - **Recommendations**: This indicates that we should focus on achieving success faster through adjustments in reward components.\n   - **Action**: A more streamlined approach to reward design will likely reduce the episode lengths.\n\n### Updated Reward Function\n\nHere\u2019s a new revised version of the reward function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Tuple, Dict\n\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(root_positions: torch.Tensor, root_linvels: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Define constants\n    target_position = torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0, 1.0], device=root_positions.device)\n    position_scale = 25.0  # Reduced scale for position\n    velocity_scale = -5.0   # Increased penalty on undesirable speeds\n    task_score_scale = 2.0   # Scale for hovering task score\n\n    # Temperature parameters\n    position_temp = 1.0\n    velocity_temp = 0.1\n    task_score_temp = 0.5\n\n    # Calculate position error\n    position_error = root_positions - target_position\n    position_distance = torch.norm(position_error, dim=-1)\n\n    # Calculate linear velocity magnitude\n    velocity_magnitude = torch.norm(root_linvels, dim=-1)\n\n    # Reward components\n    position_reward = torch.exp(-position_temp * position_scale * torch.clamp(position_distance, 0, 1))\n    velocity_reward = torch.exp(velocity_temp * velocity_scale * torch.clamp(0.2 - velocity_magnitude, min=0.0))  # Emphasizing modest control\n    task_score_reward = task_score_scale * torch.where(position_distance < 0.2, torch.tensor(1.0, device=root_positions.device), torch.tensor(0.0, device=root_positions.device))\n\n    # Total reward\n    total_reward = position_reward + velocity_reward + task_score_reward\n\n    # Create component dictionary\n    reward_components = {\n        'position_reward': position_reward,\n        'velocity_reward': velocity_reward,\n        'task_score_reward': task_score_reward,\n    }\n\n    return total_reward, reward_components\n```\n\n### Summary of Changes\n- **Position Reward**: Made more sensitive to proximity with a controlled scale property to encourage reaching the target.\n- **Velocity Reward**: Increased the penalty on unwanted velocities to promote softer flight dynamics while hovering.\n- **Task Score Reward**: Simplified and rearranged so that it consistently rewards the quadcopter for staying within desired ranges.\n- **Overall Efficiency**: The approach balances robustness in achieving each key task while potentially reducing episode lengths by focusing on success rates.\n\nThis revised function should better encourage the agent to optimize its behavior towards the task of aiming for and hovering around the target position successfully."

Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:\n    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function\n    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider\n        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter\n        (b) Re-writing the reward component \n        (c) Discarding the reward component\n    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range\nPlease analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable.
