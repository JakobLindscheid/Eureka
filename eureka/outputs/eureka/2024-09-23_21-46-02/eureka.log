Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

The feedback from the previous training indicates some important issues:

1. **Position Reward**: The maximum, mean, and minimum values for the position reward are all identical (0.01). This suggests that RL is unable to optimize this component effectively, leading to an insufficient incentive to reduce the position error. This component could benefit from a scale adjustment or an additional penalty for being far from the target.

2. **Velocity Reward**: This reward has significantly larger values (Max: 1014271.38, Mean: 731456.32, Min: 1.32), indicating that it dominates the overall reward. The extreme discrepancy between the values suggests that it's not appropriately scaled. Its temperature should also be adjusted to normalize its effect on the reward function.

3. **Task Score**: This component appears to hover around negative values, suggesting that the task is not producing positive rewards. This indicates that the overall task could be rewarding but may require modifications in the reward components.

4. **Episode Lengths**: The episode lengths suggest that the quadcopter is navigating but not successfully reaching the target, resulting in a likely ineffective exploration or reward structure.

Considering the above issues, I will revise the reward function to:

- Enhance the position reward with a squared penalty for distance and a scaling factor.
- Fine-tune the velocity reward to both penalize high velocities and incentivize low velocities.
- Combine position and velocity rewards into a more balanced overall reward.

Here's the updated reward function code:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_positions: torch.Tensor, root_linvels: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Define constants
    target_position = torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0, 1.0], device=root_positions.device)
    position_scale = 10.0  # Increased to enhance the feedback for position
    velocity_scale = -0.5   # Decreased to prevent excessive penalty
    position_temp = 0.5
    velocity_temp = 0.05

    # Calculate position error
    position_error = root_positions - target_position
    position_distance = torch.norm(position_error, dim=-1)
    
    # Calculate linear velocity magnitude
    velocity_magnitude = torch.norm(root_linvels, dim=-1)

    # Reward components
    position_reward = torch.exp(-position_temp * position_scale * (position_distance ** 2))  # Exponential decay based on squared distance
    velocity_reward = torch.exp(-velocity_temp * velocity_scale * velocity_magnitude)  # Improve scaling and encourage lower velocities

    # Total reward
    total_reward = position_reward + velocity_reward

    # Create component dictionary
    reward_components = {
        'position_reward': position_reward,
        'velocity_reward': velocity_reward,
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
``` 

This revised function seeks to better balance the position and velocity rewards, enhancing the learning signal from positional achievements while still discouraging excessive velocity. This should improve the overall performance of the RL agent in reaching and hovering near the target position.

Based on the policy feedback, several observations can be made regarding the individual components of the reward function:

### Analysis of Reward Components:

1. **Position Reward**:
   - The position reward values have improved significantly, showing that the quadcopter is making progress towards the target. However, the mean value of 0.62 and a range reaching up to 0.87 indicate that there is still room for improvement. To further incentivize reaching closer to the target, I will increase the scaling factor and modify the penalty structure.
   
2. **Velocity Reward**:
   - The velocity reward values are relatively stable, with a mean around 1.03. This consistency suggests it is not being effectively optimized. To encourage lower velocities unless necessary, I will scale the temperature down and adjust the exponential decay to apply more pressure to higher velocities.
   
3. **Task Score**:
   - The task score has become less negative but still hovers in the negative range. This score should be re-evaluated to become a positive incentive by considering a reward for staying within a defined distance from the target, rather than just penalizing failures.
   
4. **Episode Lengths**:
   - The increasing episode lengths indicate that the quadcopter is taking longer to complete tasks, potentially due to suboptimal actions due to reward values not reflecting task success adequately. This is a sign that the agent may be exploring but failing to converge towards a consistent success.

Based on the observations, I will adjust the reward function as follows:

### New Reward Function Structure:
- **Position Reward**: Enhance the position incentive by changing the reward scaling and shifting the position penalty formula.
- **Velocity Reward**: Adjust the temperature to penalize faster speeds more severely while still rewarding lower speeds.
- **Task Score**: Introduce a new positive component for successful hovering near the target to encourage ongoing success.

Here's the updated reward function code:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_positions: torch.Tensor, root_linvels: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Define constants
    target_position = torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0, 1.0], device=root_positions.device)
    position_scale = 30.0   # Enhanced scaling for position reward
    velocity_scale = -1.0    # Adjusted to penalize excessive velocities
    task_score_scale = 1.5    # New scaling for task score
    position_temp = 0.5
    velocity_temp = 0.1
    task_score_temp = 1.0

    # Calculate position error
    position_error = root_positions - target_position
    position_distance = torch.norm(position_error, dim=-1)

    # Calculate linear velocity magnitude
    velocity_magnitude = torch.norm(root_linvels, dim=-1)

    # Reward components
    position_reward = torch.exp(-position_temp * position_scale * (position_distance ** 2))  # Encourage getting closer
    velocity_reward = torch.exp(velocity_temp * velocity_scale * velocity_magnitude)  # Emphasize low velocities

    # New task score based on distance to the target
    task_score = torch.where(position_distance < 0.5, torch.tensor(1.0, device=root_positions.device), torch.tensor(0.0, device=root_positions.device))
    task_score_reward = task_score * task_score_scale  # Scale up the task score

    # Total reward
    total_reward = position_reward + velocity_reward + task_score_reward

    # Create component dictionary
    reward_components = {
        'position_reward': position_reward,
        'velocity_reward': velocity_reward,
        'task_score_reward': task_score_reward,
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
``` 

This updated function should improve the agent's learning process by providing more significant incentives for reaching the target position, controlling speed more effectively, and rewarding successful hovering actions. The changes should lead to better policy performance and ultimately higher success rates.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Based on the analysis of the policy feedback, we can draw the following conclusions about each reward component:

1. **Position Reward**:
   - **Analysis**: The position reward has shown a good maximum value of 0.97, but the mean reward of 0.63 and some minimum values (including 0.00) indicate that it is not consistently effective at encouraging the quadcopter to reach the target. The low minima suggest that when the quadcopter is far from the target, it receives little to no reward.
   - **Recommendation**: Adjust the penalty for being away from the target. Additionally, instead of squaring the distance in the exponential decay, we can transition to a more sensitive decay system that emphasizes closer distances and works better near the target.

2. **Velocity Reward**:
   - **Analysis**: The velocity reward values are stable, with little variance (mean of 0.93). This suggests that the RL agent is not effectively optimizing this component as it is currently written, indicating that it may be receiving sufficient penalties, leading to stagnation.
   - **Recommendation**: Scale down the penalty in the velocity component. Let's modify the velocity reward to encourage a more specific threshold for velocity to promote better control without excessive penalty.

3. **Task Score Reward**:
   - **Analysis**: The task score has an impressive max value of 1.50, but its minimum value is 0.03, showing some inconsistency. The mean (1.27) indicates that when the quadcopter does hover, it is rewarded. However, the significantly negative task score raises flags.
   - **Recommendation**: Transform the task score to emphasize positive hovering more effectively and “reward persistence” by encouraging staying within a smaller region around the target instead of solely penalizing when out of bounds.

4. **Episode Lengths**:
   - **Analysis**: The episode lengths show high variability, with maximum lengths of 499 indicating potential long task completion times, which may signify inefficient learning, possibly from a poor balance of reward structures.
   - **Recommendation**: Integrate a new reward structure to ascertain that not only goal reaching but also efficient hovering is encouraged so that episodes can complete more efficiently.

Based on all these considerations, here is the recommended revised reward function:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_positions: torch.Tensor, root_linvels: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Define constants
    target_position = torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0, 1.0], device=root_positions.device)
    position_scale = 50.0  # More sensitive scaling for position reward
    velocity_scale = -0.5    # Reduced penalty on velocity
    task_score_scale = 2.0    # Elevated scale for "hovering" task score
    position_temp = 1.0
    velocity_temp = 0.05
    task_score_temp = 0.5

    # Calculate position error
    position_error = root_positions - target_position
    position_distance = torch.norm(position_error, dim=-1)

    # Calculate linear velocity magnitude
    velocity_magnitude = torch.norm(root_linvels, dim=-1)

    # Reward components
    position_reward = torch.exp(-position_temp * position_scale * (torch.clamp(position_distance, min=0.0, max=1.0) ** 2))  # Focus on proximity
    velocity_reward = torch.exp(velocity_temp * velocity_scale * (torch.clamp(velocity_magnitude - 0.2, min=0.0, max=1.0)))  # Encourage low controlled speed
    
    # New task score based on distance to the target and rewards for nearest hovering
    task_score = torch.where(position_distance < 0.2, torch.tensor(1.0, device=root_positions.device), torch.tensor(0.0, device=root_positions.device))
    task_score_reward = task_score * task_score_scale

    # Total reward
    total_reward = position_reward + velocity_reward + task_score_reward

    # Create component dictionary
    reward_components = {
        'position_reward': position_reward,
        'velocity_reward': velocity_reward,
        'task_score_reward': task_score_reward,
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Summary of the Changes:
- **Position Reward**: Increased the sensitivity to be more effective when the quadcopter is near the target.
- **Velocity Reward**: Reduced overly harsh penalties for velocity while emphasizing controlled flight speed.
- **Task Score Reward**: Enhanced the reward for hovering in proximity to the target, thus promoting more consistent and effective hovering behavior.
- **Overall Architecture**: Reflected the need for all components to blend together for achieving coherent task success and ensure episodes proceed efficiently.

These updates are designed to improve the learning experience for the agent, focusing on more responsive rewards that reflect the inherent tasks successfully completed.

Let's carefully analyze the provided feedback on the reward components:

### Reward Component Analysis

1. **Position Reward**:
   - **Values**: The max (0.90) and mean (0.61) suggest that the quadcopter is sometimes close to the target, but a minimum of 0.00 indicates that it is often far away.
   - **Recommendations**: The position reward needs to be made more sensitive and consistent. We can change the scale and introduce a more informative reward structure that emphasizes proximity to the target.
   - **Action**: Revise the position reward formula and balance around a target distance.

2. **Velocity Reward**:
   - **Values**: It consistently returns values close to 1.00. The mean is 0.99 with a minimum of 0.98 indicating that it is not effectively optimized anymore.
   - **Recommendations**: Consider scaling down the velocity reward or adjusting the penalty to further fine-tune the learning process since it appears to be saturating.
   - **Action**: We can re-design this component to offer a greater penalty for higher velocities that are undesirable for hovering.

3. **Task Score Reward**:
   - **Values**: The max (1.97) and mean (1.56) are relatively high, but the minimum being at 0.00 suggests that it is often not rewarded for being within range of the target.
   - **Recommendations**: This component is important but needs more scrutiny on how we penalize being away from the target. The presence of negative task scores was troubling, indicating the negative penalties might be too harsh.
   - **Action**: We should consider re-scaling to promote consistent hovering and modify the conditions under which the reward is diminished.

4. **General Episode Lengths**:
   - **Values**: The range of episode lengths indicates potential inefficiency. The large maximum episode length (499) along with a mean length (478) suggests that the quadcopter might be struggling to learn effectively.
   - **Recommendations**: This indicates that we should focus on achieving success faster through adjustments in reward components.
   - **Action**: A more streamlined approach to reward design will likely reduce the episode lengths.

### Updated Reward Function

Here’s a new revised version of the reward function:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_positions: torch.Tensor, root_linvels: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Define constants
    target_position = torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0, 1.0], device=root_positions.device)
    position_scale = 25.0  # Reduced scale for position
    velocity_scale = -5.0   # Increased penalty on undesirable speeds
    task_score_scale = 2.0   # Scale for hovering task score

    # Temperature parameters
    position_temp = 1.0
    velocity_temp = 0.1
    task_score_temp = 0.5

    # Calculate position error
    position_error = root_positions - target_position
    position_distance = torch.norm(position_error, dim=-1)

    # Calculate linear velocity magnitude
    velocity_magnitude = torch.norm(root_linvels, dim=-1)

    # Reward components
    position_reward = torch.exp(-position_temp * position_scale * torch.clamp(position_distance, 0, 1))
    velocity_reward = torch.exp(velocity_temp * velocity_scale * torch.clamp(0.2 - velocity_magnitude, min=0.0))  # Emphasizing modest control
    task_score_reward = task_score_scale * torch.where(position_distance < 0.2, torch.tensor(1.0, device=root_positions.device), torch.tensor(0.0, device=root_positions.device))

    # Total reward
    total_reward = position_reward + velocity_reward + task_score_reward

    # Create component dictionary
    reward_components = {
        'position_reward': position_reward,
        'velocity_reward': velocity_reward,
        'task_score_reward': task_score_reward,
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Summary of Changes
- **Position Reward**: Made more sensitive to proximity with a controlled scale property to encourage reaching the target.
- **Velocity Reward**: Increased the penalty on unwanted velocities to promote softer flight dynamics while hovering.
- **Task Score Reward**: Simplified and rearranged so that it consistently rewards the quadcopter for staying within desired ranges.
- **Overall Efficiency**: The approach balances robustness in achieving each key task while potentially reducing episode lengths by focusing on success rates.

This revised function should better encourage the agent to optimize its behavior towards the task of aiming for and hovering around the target position successfully.
