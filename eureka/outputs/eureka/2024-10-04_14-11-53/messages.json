As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.\n"

        "content": "### Analysis of Policy Feedback\n\n1. **Forward Reward**:\n   - **Feedback**: Max: 1.72, Mean: 1.18, Min: 0.02 \n   - **Analysis**: The forward reward shows a decent range indicating the agent has learned to move forward at times, but the minimum value being so low (0.02) suggests there are episodes where it fails to move forward effectively. This component can continue to be part of the reward function, but the temperature scaling should be increased to enhance the sensitivity of the reward signal relative to movement.\n\n2. **Task Score**:\n   - **Feedback**: Max: -1.00, Mean: -1.00, Min: -1.00\n   - **Analysis**: This component has constant negative values, indicating that it is not providing informative feedback as it stands. Since it does not change and fails to encourage movement towards the target, this reward should be discarded entirely.\n\n3. **Proximity Reward**:\n   - **Feedback**: Max: 1.22, Mean: 0.40, Min: -0.48\n   - **Analysis**: The proximity reward shows a range of values suggesting it is somewhat informative, but negative values are present which indicates it is not consistently encouraging the right behavior towards the target. This reward component should be redefined to provide positive feedback when the ant moves closer to the target.\n\n4. **Episode Lengths**:\n   - **Feedback**: Max: 17.71, Mean: 11.15, Min: 11.00 \n   - **Analysis**: The episode lengths seem fairly consistent and do not provide much insight into whether the agent is successful in accomplishing the task. We can ignore episode length in the reward function.\n\n### Proposed New Reward Function\n\nBased on the analysis, we will refine the reward function as follows:\n\n- **Forward Reward**: Keep this component but increase the temperature for better sensitivity.\n- **Redefined Proximity Reward**: This reward will now positively reinforce being closer to the target without incurring negatives. We will calculate the distance to the target and normalize it positively.\n\nHere's the revised reward function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Tuple, Dict\n\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, dt: float) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Extract information from root_states\n    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]  # Position (x, y, z)\n    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]        # Velocity (vx, vy, vz)\n\n    # Forward movement reward (x direction)\n    forward_speed = velocity[:, 0]          # Get forward velocity along x-axis\n    forward_temp = 5.0                       # Increased temperature for forward reward scaling\n    forward_reward = torch.exp(forward_speed / forward_temp) - 1  # Exponential scaling\n\n    # Distance to target with a positive proximity reward\n    to_target = targets - torso_position\n    distance_to_target = torch.norm(to_target, p=2, dim=-1)  # Euclidean distance\n    max_distance = 10.0                        # Arbitrary maximum distance for normalization\n    proximity_temp = 3.0                       # Temperature for proximity reward\n    proximity_reward = torch.exp((max_distance - distance_to_target) / proximity_temp) - 1\n\n    # Total reward \n    total_reward = forward_reward + proximity_reward\n\n    # Individual reward components\n    reward_components = {\n        'forward_reward': forward_reward,\n        'proximity_reward': proximity_reward\n    }\n\n    return total_reward, reward_components\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- **Forward Reward**: The forward reward is retained but enhanced sensitivity by increasing the temperature value from 2.0 to 5.0, thus ensuring the reward for faster movement is more pronounced.\n- **New Proximity Reward**: Introduced a new proximity reward that rewards the ant positively for decreasing the distance to the target. This makes it more likely that the ant will receive reinforcement for getting closer to its goal.\n- **Discarded Uninformative Components**: Removed the task score entirely as it provided no useful learning signal.\n- **Single Responsibility**: Each component is now clearly defined with a specific purpose, allowing for smoother feedback during the training of the RL agent.\n\nThis refined reward function should help the ant learn to move forward more effectively while incentivizing it to approach its target."
