Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Based on the feedback provided, we can analyze the current reward components:

1. **forward_reward**: 
   - The values are consistently between 1.00 and 1.08 which suggests that the agent may not be effectively optimizing this component. It yields limited variability, indicating potential saturation in its current formulation. 
   - To improve upon this, we can introduce a scaling factor and normalize the forward speed relative to a threshold that indicates fast forward movement.

2. **distance_reward**: 
   - All values are 0.00, signifying that the agent is not being rewarded for moving closer to its target. This component is ineffective in its current state.
   - We can reformulate this component to provide positive reward feedback when the agent approaches the target by using a negative function of the distance.

3. **task_score**: 
   - The mean score of 0.30 with a maximum of 0.81 indicates that there is some variability in performance, but the overall values suggest that this metric could be better tied to the other components.
   - We can integrate a more direct correlation by involving both movement speed and proximity to the target.

4. **episode_lengths**:
   - The episode lengths decrease slightly over epochs, which may indicate improvement but should ideally be tied more directly to a reward.

Considering these observations, an improved reward function should:
- Scale the forward movement reward.
- Implement a proper reward for decreasing distance to the target.
- Combine these elements into a cohesive total reward that encourages both moving forward and closing the distance to the goal.

Here's the suggested new reward function code:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, dt: float) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract necessary information from root_states
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]  # Position (x, y, z)
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]        # Velocity (vx, vy, vz)

    # Calculate the forward movement (x direction)
    forward_speed = velocity[:, 0]
    
    # Calculate the distance to target
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    distance_to_target = torch.norm(to_target, p=2, dim=-1)  # Euclidean distance

    # Constants (you may need to adjust these further based on experimentation)
    speed_threshold = 1.0  # Define a threshold for good forward speed
    distance_reward_scale = 0.1  # Scale for distance reward

    # Define temperature parameters for normalization
    speed_temp: float = 0.5
    distance_temp: float = 0.1
    
    # Reward components
    # Normalize forward speed and provide reward based on a threshold
    forward_reward = torch.clamp(torch.exp(forward_speed / speed_threshold) - 1, min=0)  # Clamping to avoid negative rewards
    
    # Provide a reward based on inverse distance to target
    distance_reward = -distance_reward_scale * distance_to_target
    
    # Total reward
    total_reward = forward_reward + torch.exp(distance_temp * distance_reward)

    # Individual reward components
    reward_components = {
        'forward_reward': forward_reward,
        'distance_reward': distance_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
``` 

This new reward function should better incentivize the ant to move forward while also providing meaningful feedback when it approaches the target.

Analyzing the policy feedback:

1. **Forward Reward**:
   - The forward reward values are reasonably varied with a maximum of 14.86 and a minimum of 0.53, suggesting some variability and potential for optimization.
   - However, since the maximum value is relatively high compared to the distance reward, we may need to re-scale this reward to maintain a balanced reward structure.

2. **Distance Reward**:
   - The distance reward is consistently -100.00, indicating that the ant is likely unable to reach the target, or the reward for distance is penalizing it greatly.
   - This component is not effectively providing positive feedback for moving closer to the target and should be re-written or eliminated. We will replace it with a reward that reflects the improvement in distance to the target rather than a negative penalty.

3. **Task Score**:
   - The task score ranges from 0.00 to 1.40, indicating variability, but the mean of 0.34 suggests limited success in optimizing this metric effectively.
   - This component should be more robustly connected to the total distance and speed metrics. We may consider modifying its formulation to better reflect the relationship with movement towards the target.

4. **Episode Lengths**:
   - The episode lengths fluctuate slightly but indicate that the agent is encountering a consistent pacing of the episode, which is a good sign. However, it doesn't directly correlate with the task's success.
   - This metric does not require a reward component but rather serves as an observation to ensure the agent isn't getting stuck.

To improve the reward function, we'll:
- Re-scale the forward reward.
- Replace the distance reward with a positive component that rewards the ant for reducing the distance to the target.
- Adjust the task score to reflect a combination of forward speed and distance to the target.

Here's the modified reward function code:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, dt: float) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract necessary information from root_states
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]  # Position (x, y, z)
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]        # Velocity (vx, vy, vz)

    # Calculate the forward movement (x direction)
    forward_speed = velocity[:, 0]

    # Calculate the distance to target
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    distance_to_target = torch.norm(to_target, p=2, dim=-1)  # Euclidean distance

    # Constants for scaling
    speed_threshold = 1.0  # Threshold for meaningful forward speed
    distance_reward_scale = 1.0  # Scale for distance reward
    successful_proximity = 2.0  # Proximity reward when close (less than 2 units)

    # Define temperature parameters for normalization
    speed_temp: float = 0.3
    proximity_temp: float = 0.1

    # Reward components
    # Normalize forward speed
    forward_reward = torch.clamp(torch.exp(forward_speed / speed_threshold) - 1, min=0)

    # Reward for reducing distance to target (more negative distance has less reward)
    proximity_reward = torch.where(distance_to_target < successful_proximity, 
                                   torch.exp((successful_proximity - distance_to_target) / successful_proximity) - 1, 
                                   torch.tensor(0.0, device=root_states.device))

    # Total reward
    total_reward = forward_reward + proximity_reward

    # Individual reward components
    reward_components = {
        'forward_reward': forward_reward,
        'proximity_reward': proximity_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Forward Reward**: The use of `torch.clamp` and an exponential function helps avoid saturating near the lower end.
2. **Distance Reward**: This was replaced by `proximity_reward`, which provides a reward based on getting closer to a target instead of a penalty, making it more informative and positive.
3. **Task Score**: This is no longer directly used but is now reflected in the formulations of distance and forward speed, ensuring that the agent is encouraged to achieve both objectives.

This revised reward function should serve to encourage the ant to move forward while rewarding it for approaching the target.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Analyzing the provided policy feedback thoroughly, we consider the following points:

1. **Forward Reward**:
   - The maximum value of 14.86 is relatively high and indicates that the forward movement is incentivized correctly. However, the minimum value of 0.47 suggests that there are instances where the ant is not moving forward effectively, which can indicate frustrations in learning optimal policies. The mean of 12.10 implies that the agent is receiving a reasonable amount of reward for moving forward, but there is limited variability.
   - **Recommendation**: Maintain this reward component but consider re-scaling it slightly to ensure it remains well-bounded compared to the other components.

2. **Proximity Reward**:
   - The proximity reward has a max, mean, and min of 0.00, showing that this component does not provide meaningful or actionable feedback to the agent. Thus, it is ineffective in guiding the policy learning.
   - **Recommendation**: This reward should be discarded since it does not contribute positively to learning.

3. **Task Score**:
   - The task score has shown limited variability across the training period, with a max of 1.53 and a very low mean of 0.39, indicating it is not strongly incentivizing desired behaviors effectively. The negative minimum of -0.73 indicates that the agent may face penalties that decrease learning efficacy.
   - **Recommendation**: Re-write this to provide a more meaningful and positive reward based on the agent's behavior towards the target (like rewarding forward movement towards it rather than penalizing).

4. **Episode Lengths**:
   - The episode lengths are stable, having a mean of ~11.68, indicating the ant completes its movements in a relatively predictable fashion; however, this does not directly relate to task success.
   - **Recommendation**: This is simply an observation and does not require a reward component.

### New Reward Function

Based on the analysis:

- We will maintain the forward reward but normalize it.
- We will discard the proximity reward and replace the task score reward with a reward based on advancing towards the target using both speed and distance metrics.

Here’s the revised reward function code:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, dt: float) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract necessary information from root_states
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]  # Position (x, y, z)
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]        # Velocity (vx, vy, vz)

    # Forward movement reward (x direction)
    forward_speed = velocity[:, 0]
    forward_reward = torch.clamp(torch.exp(forward_speed) - 1, min=0)

    # Calculate the distance to target
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    distance_to_target = torch.norm(to_target, p=2, dim=-1)  # Euclidean distance

    # New reward for improving distance to target
    # Reward is based on getting closer to the target in a way that is positively correlated
    # If the distance to target decreases, that should return a positive reward
    successful_proximity_threshold = 2.0  # Define threshold for rewarded proximity
    proximity_reward = torch.where(distance_to_target < successful_proximity_threshold, 
                                   (successful_proximity_threshold - distance_to_target) / successful_proximity_threshold, 
                                   torch.tensor(0.0, device=root_states.device))

    # Total reward
    total_reward = forward_reward + proximity_reward

    # Individual reward components
    reward_components = {
        'forward_reward': forward_reward,
        'proximity_reward': proximity_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Forward Reward**: Adjusted the scaling but kept the structure; rewards for moving quickly in the forward direction are preserved since it is a significant aspect of the task.
2. **Proximity Reward**: Based on the distance to the target, allowing the agent to gain rewards when it becomes closer, establishing a better gradient towards the target.
3. **Task Score Replacement**: Not directly implemented but an integral part of the proximity reward.

This reward function aims to provide better corrective action signals, enabling the ant to learn effective behaviors toward the target while rewarding its successful forward movements.

#### Analysis of Existing Reward Components:

1. **Forward Reward**:
   - **Values**: Range from a minimum of 0.47 to a maximum of 14.86, with a mean of 12.10.
   - **Analysis**: Given the significant variability and generally reasonable rewards for forward movement, this component is encouraging forward progress effectively but can benefit from re-scaling and normalization.
   - **Action**: Introduce a temperature parameter to adjust the scaling, emphasizing the component when the ant moves faster.

2. **Proximity Reward**:
   - **Values**: Remains constant at 0.00 for all epochs, indicating that the reward function is ineffective in providing feedback related to proximity to the target.
   - **Analysis**: No learning can occur regarding this component since it does not yield any positive rewards.
   - **Action**: This reward component should be rewritten to provide useful feedback based on approaching the target as the previous formulation did not work.

3. **Task Score**:
   - **Values**: Vary from -0.73 to 1.53, with a mean of 0.39. 
   - **Analysis**: The negativity of scores affecting the learning process is evident, as it introduces penalties that do not benefit the agent's learning.
   - **Action**: This component should be redefined to contribute positively, perhaps by providing rewards for minimizing the distance to the target.

4. **Episode Lengths**:
   - **Values**: Range from 11.37 to 17.49 with a mean of 11.68, suggesting consistent completion of episodes without variation correlating with task success.
   - **Analysis**: While it might provide a rough measure of agent activity, it does not reflect success in accomplishing the actual goal.
   - **Action**: This information does not directly translate into feedback for the agent and doesn't need to be converted into a reward.

### Proposed Revised Reward Function

Combining these analyses, the new reward function will adjust the forward reward to utilize a temperature parameter for better scaling. The proximity reward will be implemented to reward closer distances to the target, thus promoting effective movement towards the goal. The task score will boil down to a positive feedback mechanism reflecting progress towards the target.

Here's the revised reward function:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, dt: float) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract necessary information from root_states
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]  # Position (x, y, z)
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]        # Velocity (vx, vy, vz)

    # Forward movement reward (x direction)
    forward_speed = velocity[:, 0]
    forward_temp = 1.0  # temperature parameter for forward reward scaling
    forward_reward = torch.exp(forward_speed / forward_temp) - 1  # Exponential scaling

    # Calculate the distance to target
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    distance_to_target = torch.norm(to_target, p=2, dim=-1)  # Euclidean distance

    # New proximity reward: provide reward based on distance from target
    max_proximity_reward = 10.0  # Maximum reward for being at target
    successful_proximity_threshold = 2.0
    proximity_reward = torch.where(distance_to_target < successful_proximity_threshold, 
                                   (successful_proximity_threshold - distance_to_target) / successful_proximity_threshold * max_proximity_reward, 
                                   torch.tensor(0.0, device=root_states.device))

    # Total reward
    total_reward = forward_reward + proximity_reward

    # Individual reward components
    reward_components = {
        'forward_reward': forward_reward,
        'proximity_reward': proximity_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Forward Reward**: Incorporated an exponential function with a temperature parameter to allow for better scaling of forward speed incentives.
2. **Proximity Reward**: Created a new mechanism that rewards the agent based on its distance to the target, ensuring it gets positive feedback when close to the goal.
3. **Task Score and Episode Length**: Not utilized in rewards due to prior analyses indicating their ineffectiveness in leading to improvements for the task.

This updated reward structure is designed to provide a more robust learning signal, guiding the ant towards the goal more effectively while still rewarding its forward movement.

### Analysis of Existing Reward Components:

1. **Forward Reward**:
   - **Statistics**: Max: 13.54, Mean: 11.43, Min: 0.18
   - **Analysis**: The forward reward values are reasonably high but also can vary quite a bit, with a minimum close to zero. This suggests that while the agent is generally rewarded for forward movement, it does not consistently translate into meaningful improvements. The agent may not be completing the task effectively since the reward does not reflect that.
   - **Action**: Introduce a temperature parameter to adjust scaling and apply a more gradual reward structure as the ant increases forward speed.

2. **Proximity Reward**:
   - **Statistics**: Max: 0.00, Mean: 0.00, Min: 0.00
   - **Analysis**: Since the proximity reward is always zero, it clearly indicates that this component is ineffective in providing feedback to the agent. This could mean that the ant is not approaching the target at all.
   - **Action**: This component should be rewritten to provide a more useful feedback mechanism based on the distance to the target.

3. **Task Score**:
   - **Statistics**: Max: 1.22, Mean: 0.41, Min: -0.64
   - **Analysis**: The task score fluctuates, although its mean is still quite low. This indicates mixed performance with some episodes providing a slight positive contribution while others are negative.
   - **Action**: Instead of a task score that can dip below zero, redefine it to ensure it serves as a positive encouragement mechanism for reaching the goal.

4. **Episode Lengths**:
   - **Statistics**: Max: 16.07, Mean: 11.84, Min: 11.42
   - **Analysis**: The episode lengths are fairly stable, indicating that the ant is completing episodes without making significant progress towards the goal. This is a signal that the agent is not improving over time.
   - **Action**: This metric should not be included in the rewards as it does not reflect success or learning.

### Proposed Revised Reward Function

Given the analysis, we will create a new reward function with the following adjustments:
- Introduce a temperature parameter for the forward reward to modulate scaling.
- Rewrite the proximity reward to provide feedback based on how close the ant is to the target.
- Redefine the task score to provide positive feedback when the agent makes progress toward the goal.

Here’s the revised reward function:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, dt: float) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract necessary information from root_states
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]  # Position (x, y, z)
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]        # Velocity (vx, vy, vz)

    # Forward movement reward (x direction)
    forward_speed = velocity[:, 0]
    forward_temp = 1.0  # Temperature for forward reward scaling
    forward_reward = torch.exp(forward_speed / forward_temp) - 1  # Exponential scaling

    # New proximity reward: calculate distance to target
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    distance_to_target = torch.norm(to_target, p=2, dim=-1)  # Euclidean distance
    max_distance = 10.0  # Maximum distance for scaling purposes
    proximity_temp = 2.0  # Temperature for proximity reward scaling
    proximity_reward = torch.exp((max_distance - distance_to_target) / proximity_temp) - 1

    # New task reward: give reward based on progress towards the target
    progress_reward = torch.where(distance_to_target < max_distance, 
                                  max_distance - distance_to_target, 
                                  torch.tensor(0.0, device=root_states.device))

    # Total reward
    total_reward = forward_reward + proximity_reward + progress_reward

    # Individual reward components
    reward_components = {
        'forward_reward': forward_reward,
        'proximity_reward': proximity_reward,
        'progress_reward': progress_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Forward Reward**: Modified to use exponential scaling to encourage higher forward speeds significantly.
- **Proximity Reward**: Rewritten to provide feedback based on decreasing distance to the target, ensuring that any effort to get closer is rewarded positively.
- **Progress Reward**: A new positive feedback mechanism based on how close the agent gets to the target enhances the motivation for the agent to approach its goal.
- **Episode Lengths**: Not used in the reward structure as they do not correlate with specific learning progress in tasks.

This updated reward structure is designed to provide a more engaging and insightful learning signal, guiding the ant not just toward forward movement but effectively towards the goal as well.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 300 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
forward_reward: ['0.55', '12.12', '12.56', '12.99', '13.40', '13.76', '14.63', '12.93', '13.69', '14.02'], Max: 15.63, Mean: 12.78, Min: 0.45 
proximity_reward: ['-1.00', '-1.00', '-1.00', '-1.00', '-1.00', '-1.00', '-1.00', '-1.00', '-1.00', '-1.00'], Max: -1.00, Mean: -1.00, Min: -1.00

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

### Analysis of Policy Feedback

1. **Forward Reward**:
   - **Feedback**: Max: 15.63, Mean: 12.78, Min: 0.45
   - **Analysis**: The forward reward exhibits a high variance and shows that the agent is able to achieve high forward speeds, indicating it is optimizing this reward component. However, the minimum value suggests there are episodes where the ant doesn't move forward effectively, meaning the scaling of this reward might need adjustments to encourage consistent active movement.
   - **Action**: Adjust the temperature parameter to ensure it encourages movement consistently.

2. **Proximity Reward**:
   - **Feedback**: Max: -1.00, Mean: -1.00, Min: -1.00 
   - **Analysis**: The proximity reward is consistently -1.00, which indicates this component is ineffective and not providing useful feedback. It seems the agent does not get close to the target, possibly due to poor incentives to move towards it.
   - **Action**: The proximity reward should be removed entirely from the reward structure. Its current implementation provides no informative signal and detracts from learning.

3. **Progress Reward**:
   - **Feedback**: Max: 0.00, Mean: 0.00, Min: 0.00 
   - **Analysis**: This reward component also consistently returns 0, meaning it's not providing any feedback to the agent, indicating no progress is rewarded.
   - **Action**: Like the proximity reward, this should be rewritten to encourage the ant to make progress towards the goal.

4. **Task Score**:
   - **Feedback**: Max: 1.15, Mean: 0.40, Min: -0.39 
   - **Analysis**: The task score has a somewhat low mean, suggesting the agent struggles to achieve the task effectively despite occasionally hitting a higher score. However, the presence of negative values indicates that the scoring rewards should be more positively defined.
   - **Action**: Redefine this task reward to reinforce consistent positive feedback and discourage negative outcomes.

5. **Episode Lengths**:
   - **Feedback**: Max: 15.85, Mean: 11.57, Min: 11.31 
   - **Analysis**: Episode lengths are fairly consistent, but they neither improve nor correlate with success rates, leading to the conclusion that they do not provide meaningful information for reward shaping.
   - **Action**: Do not include episode lengths in the reward structure.

### Proposed Revised Reward Function

Based on the analysis, we are going to create a new reward function as follows:

- Retain the forward reward but adjust its scaling.
- Discard the ineffective proximity and progress rewards.
- Revamp the task score to start rewarding positive distances to the target.

Here’s the revised reward function:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, dt: float) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract information from root_states
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]  # Position (x, y, z)
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]        # Velocity (vx, vy, vz)

    # Forward movement reward (x direction)
    forward_speed = velocity[:, 0]          # Get forward velocity along x-axis
    forward_temp = 2.0                       # Adjusted temperature for forward reward scaling
    forward_reward = torch.exp(forward_speed / forward_temp) - 1  # Exponential scaling

    # Distance to target
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    distance_to_target = torch.norm(to_target, p=2, dim=-1)  # Euclidean distance
    max_distance = 10.0                        # Maximum distance for normalization
    task_score_temp = 5.0                      # Temperature for the task score
    task_score = torch.exp((max_distance - distance_to_target) / task_score_temp) - 1 

    # Total reward
    total_reward = forward_reward + task_score

    # Individual reward components
    reward_components = {
        'forward_reward': forward_reward,
        'task_score': task_score
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Forward Reward**: Kept but adjusted its scaling with a higher temperature for consistency in rewards. This should ensure the agent receives meaningful feedback for moving forward.
- **Removed Proximity and Progress Rewards**: Since these were not providing useful metrics for learning, they have been entirely removed.
- **Task Score**: Rewritten to reward the agent based on how close it is to the goal rather than providing negative feedback. This aims to incentivize movement towards targets.
- **Simplified Structure**: The total reward function now focuses on two distinct components that encourage desired behaviors directly.

This new reward function should provide more effective signals to the agent and help improve its ability to learn to move forward efficiently on the tilted plane.

### Analysis of Policy Feedback

1. **Forward Reward**:
   - **Feedback**: Max: 1.72, Mean: 1.18, Min: 0.02 
   - **Analysis**: The forward reward shows a decent range indicating the agent has learned to move forward at times, but the minimum value being so low (0.02) suggests there are episodes where it fails to move forward effectively. This component can continue to be part of the reward function, but the temperature scaling should be increased to enhance the sensitivity of the reward signal relative to movement.

2. **Task Score**:
   - **Feedback**: Max: -1.00, Mean: -1.00, Min: -1.00
   - **Analysis**: This component has constant negative values, indicating that it is not providing informative feedback as it stands. Since it does not change and fails to encourage movement towards the target, this reward should be discarded entirely.

3. **Proximity Reward**:
   - **Feedback**: Max: 1.22, Mean: 0.40, Min: -0.48
   - **Analysis**: The proximity reward shows a range of values suggesting it is somewhat informative, but negative values are present which indicates it is not consistently encouraging the right behavior towards the target. This reward component should be redefined to provide positive feedback when the ant moves closer to the target.

4. **Episode Lengths**:
   - **Feedback**: Max: 17.71, Mean: 11.15, Min: 11.00 
   - **Analysis**: The episode lengths seem fairly consistent and do not provide much insight into whether the agent is successful in accomplishing the task. We can ignore episode length in the reward function.

### Proposed New Reward Function

Based on the analysis, we will refine the reward function as follows:

- **Forward Reward**: Keep this component but increase the temperature for better sensitivity.
- **Redefined Proximity Reward**: This reward will now positively reinforce being closer to the target without incurring negatives. We will calculate the distance to the target and normalize it positively.

Here's the revised reward function:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, dt: float) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract information from root_states
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]  # Position (x, y, z)
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]        # Velocity (vx, vy, vz)

    # Forward movement reward (x direction)
    forward_speed = velocity[:, 0]          # Get forward velocity along x-axis
    forward_temp = 5.0                       # Increased temperature for forward reward scaling
    forward_reward = torch.exp(forward_speed / forward_temp) - 1  # Exponential scaling

    # Distance to target with a positive proximity reward
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    distance_to_target = torch.norm(to_target, p=2, dim=-1)  # Euclidean distance
    max_distance = 10.0                        # Arbitrary maximum distance for normalization
    proximity_temp = 3.0                       # Temperature for proximity reward
    proximity_reward = torch.exp((max_distance - distance_to_target) / proximity_temp) - 1

    # Total reward 
    total_reward = forward_reward + proximity_reward

    # Individual reward components
    reward_components = {
        'forward_reward': forward_reward,
        'proximity_reward': proximity_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Forward Reward**: The forward reward is retained but enhanced sensitivity by increasing the temperature value from 2.0 to 5.0, thus ensuring the reward for faster movement is more pronounced.
- **New Proximity Reward**: Introduced a new proximity reward that rewards the ant positively for decreasing the distance to the target. This makes it more likely that the ant will receive reinforcement for getting closer to its goal.
- **Discarded Uninformative Components**: Removed the task score entirely as it provided no useful learning signal.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component is now clearly defined with a specific purpose, allowing for smoother feedback during the training of the RL agent.

This refined reward function should help the ant learn to move forward more effectively while incentivizing it to approach its target.

[2024-10-04 16:08:52,792][root][INFO] - Iteration 7: User Content:
We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 300 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
forward_reward: ['0.01', '0.07', '0.42', '0.14', '0.17', '0.42', '0.08', '0.29', '0.36', '0.06'], Max: 0.44, Mean: 0.23, Min: 0.01 
proximity_reward: ['-1.00', '-1.00', '-1.00', '-1.00', '-1.00', '-1.00', '-1.00', '-1.00', '-1.00', '-1.00'], Max: -1.00, Mean: -1.00, Min: -1.00 
task_score: ['0.00', '-0.23', '1.14', '0.36', '-0.02', '1.23', '0.02', '0.38', '1.10', '-0.21'], Max: 1.24, Mean: 0.49, Min: -0.25 
episode_lengths: ['12.23', '12.41', '11.00', '11.21', '11.24', '11.13', '11.00', '11.20', '11.17', '11.44'], Max: 16.11, Mean: 11.23, Min: 11.00 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
