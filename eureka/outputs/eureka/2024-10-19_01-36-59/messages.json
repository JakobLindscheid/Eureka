        "content": "Let's analyze the provided policy feedback and reward components in detail to enhance the learning of the RL agent effectively.\n\n### Analysis of Reward Components:\n\n1. **reward_forward_speed**:\n   - **Values**: The minimum value starts at 0.01, and the maximum observed is 7.58, with a mean of 4.55. This indicates variability in the achieved forward speed but does not fully utilize the range, as it is mostly below 8. \n   - **Action**: We can retain this component but increase its sensitivity and overall contribution to the reward. Adjusting the temperature may help in exaggerating the effects of forward speed improvements.\n\n2. **sustained_speed**:\n   - **Values**: The max is 2.72, mean is 1.78, and minimum is 0.04. The values are relatively low and clustered, showing limited optimization.\n   - **Action**: Let's decrease the temperature to give a more pronounced impact on this reward. Additionally, we can calculate the sustained speed as a more defined time-averaged speed over the previous episodes.\n\n3. **reward_heading**:\n   - **Values**: With a maximum of 8.55 and a mean of 5.54, this component produces substantial feedback. However, it may not directly correlate with agent\u2019s forward motion during training.\n   - **Action**: Although it has high values, keeping it too high might overshadow other components. I would suggest normalizing this and scaling it down to maintain balance with the forward rewards.\n\n4. **task_score**:\n   - **Values**: This component seems to yield greater variability, from -0.01 to 9.96, with a mean of 7.33. The negative minimum suggests that agents may be performing poorly occasionally.\n   - **Action**: We should consider employing a capped exponential transformation to avoid extreme penalties and normalize the effect of this reward component.\n\n5. **episode_lengths**:\n   - **Values**: Episode lengths range from 44.33 to 997.11. The high variability indicates performance inconsistencies.\n   - **Action**: We will not directly include this into the reward, but this suggests the need for the agent to maintain a continuous improvement strategy in the run to stabilize its performance.\n\n### Revised Reward Function:\n\nBased on the points above, here is a new reward function designed to optimize performance while keeping the feedback balanced:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Tuple, Dict\n\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, dt: float, targets: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Unpack the root states\n    torso_velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]  # Velocity components\n    forward_velocity = torso_velocity[:, 0]  # Forward velocity (x-axis)\n    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]\n\n    # Calculate distance to the target (2D, ignoring height)\n    to_target = targets - torso_position\n    distance_to_target = torch.sqrt(to_target[:, 0]**2 + to_target[:, 1]**2)\n\n    # Enhanced reward components\n    reward_forward_speed = forward_velocity  # Reward based on forward speed\n    sustained_speed = torch.mean(forward_velocity)  # Averaging for sustained speed\n\n    # New heading reward based on the direction towards the target\n    direction_to_target = to_target / (distance_to_target.unsqueeze(-1) + 1e-5)  # Normalize direction\n    heading_dot_product = torch.sum(torso_velocity * direction_to_target, dim=-1)  # Dot product gives alignment\n\n    # Adjust the temperature parameters for transformations\n    temperature_forward = 3.0  # Increase sensitivity\n    temperature_sustained_speed = 1.5  # Lower to boost effect\n    temperature_heading = 3.0  # Keep alignment effective, but normalized\n\n    # Transforming the rewards for scaling\n    transformed_reward_forward_speed = torch.exp(reward_forward_speed / temperature_forward) - 1\n    transformed_sustained_speed = torch.exp(sustained_speed / temperature_sustained_speed) - 1  \n    transformed_reward_heading = torch.clamp(torch.exp(heading_dot_product / temperature_heading), max=10.0)  # Exponential with cap\n\n    # Total reward calculation\n    total_reward = transformed_reward_forward_speed + transformed_sustained_speed + transformed_reward_heading\n\n    # Create a dictionary for the individual reward components\n    reward_components = {\n        'reward_forward_speed': transformed_reward_forward_speed,\n        'sustained_speed': transformed_sustained_speed,\n        'reward_heading': transformed_reward_heading,\n    }\n\n    return total_reward, reward_components\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n- **Increased sensitivity** of the `reward_forward_speed` component and adjusting its temperature for more pronounced outcomes.\n- **Sustained speed** reward was averaged to ensure it reflects a clear estimate of performance over time instead of isolated moments.\n- **Normalized and bounded** the `reward_heading` component to prevent it from overshadowing or inducing erratic behavior.\n- **Overall transformation** adjustments were made to maintain a good scale among components, ensuring fair contributions towards the total reward.\n\nThis revised function should help the RL agent optimize its forward running task more effectively, providing the necessary signals to encourage consistent performance."
