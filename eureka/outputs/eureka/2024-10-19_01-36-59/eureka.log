Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Upon analyzing the feedback and statistics from the previous reward function, we can make several observations:

1. **reward_forward_speed**: 
   - The values range significantly and have a mean of 120.20, but the maximum is considerably higher (328.29). This suggests it's functioning but might benefit from a more stable scaling to ensure the agent learns more effectively across episodes.
   
2. **reward_penalty**: 
   - The values are very close to each other, which indicates that this component isn't providing sufficient informative feedback to the agent. Its mean is 0.06 and max is 0.31, suggesting it's not being effectively optimized.
   - Given that it's penalizing, it should be restructured to encourage desired behavior more effectively rather than uniformly diminishing performance.

3. **Total Reward**: 
   - The task_score shows a reasonable mean of 1.95, but the maximum fluctuates, which could benefit from a more consistent reward structure. This indicates that while the agent is progressing, the reward structure could provide improved signals.

Given these observations, we can restructure the reward function as follows:
- Maintain `reward_forward_speed` but normalize it better.
- Discard `reward_penalty` as it provides little value for feedback and introduce a new component that encourages maintaining speed over epochs while moving forward.
- Add a reward for `sustained_speed` which rewards the agent for maintaining a forward motion.

Here is the improved reward function code:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, dt: float) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Unpack the root states
    torso_velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]  # Velocity components
    forward_velocity = torso_velocity[:, 0]  # Forward velocity (x-axis)
    
    # New reward components
    reward_forward_speed = forward_velocity  # Reward based on forward speed
    sustained_speed = torch.max(forward_velocity, torch.tensor(0.0, device=root_states.device))  # Only positive forward velocity matters

    # Temperature for reward transformation
    temperature_speed = 50.0  # Change this for stability
    temperature_sustained_speed = 10.0

    # Transforming the rewards for scaling
    transformed_reward_forward_speed = torch.exp(reward_forward_speed / temperature_speed) - 1  # Shifted to be more normalized
    transformed_sustained_speed = torch.exp(sustained_speed / temperature_sustained_speed) - 1  # Shifted as well

    # Total reward calculation
    total_reward = transformed_reward_forward_speed + transformed_sustained_speed

    # Create a dictionary for the individual reward components
    reward_components = {
        'reward_forward_speed': transformed_reward_forward_speed,
        'sustained_speed': transformed_sustained_speed,
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
``` 

This updated reward function should provide a more balanced set of incentives for the ant to both achieve maximum forward velocity and maintain a suitable speed throughout its movement, ultimately improving its learning.

Let's analyze the existing components of the reward function based on the feedback provided:

1. **reward_forward_speed**:
   - The values of this component are generally low, with a maximum of 0.18 and a mean of 0.14, indicating that it is not providing sufficient differentiation for the agent. The low magnitude suggests that the scaling or optimization of this component isn't effective. Adjusting its temperature and potentially re-scaling it could provide better feedback for the policy.

2. **sustained_speed**:
   - This component shows a wider range of values, where the maximum is 1.58 and the mean is 1.11. The increasing trend suggests that the RL agent is able to optimize for sustained speed better than for forward speed. However, the scaling might still be a little off, especially compared to reward_forward_speed. Instead of directly transforming this, we will maintain the overall growth while optimizing its signal.

3. **Total Reward (task_score)**:
   - The task score has a maximum of 7.95 and an average of 6.13, implying that the agent is managing to achieve the objective to some extent. However, the existence of a minimum reward of 0.02 suggests that there are still episodes where performance is significantly lacking. 

4. **episode_lengths**:
   - The episode lengths show that the agent is not only reaching its destination but is doing so within varying lengths that can fluctuate. This indicates that there are challenges around consistent performance.

Given these insights, we should focus on making the reward function more differentiable and encouraging for both speed components. The idea is to reward not only direct forward speed but also the combination of speed and direction (to ensure the ant is moving toward the target).

Here's the revised reward function:

```python

from typing import Tuple, Dict

def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, dt: float, targets: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:

    forward_velocity = torso_velocity[:, 0]  # Forward velocity (x-axis)
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]
    
    # Calculate distance to the target (2D, ignoring height)
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    distance_to_target = torch.sqrt(to_target[:, 0]**2 + to_target[:, 1]**2)

    # New reward components
    reward_forward_speed = forward_velocity  # Reward based on forward speed
    sustained_speed = torch.max(forward_velocity, torch.tensor(0.0, device=root_states.device))  # Only positive forward velocity matters
    
    # Reward for heading towards the target
    reward_heading = torch.exp(-distance_to_target / (10.0 + 1e-5))  # Encourage to move closer to target

    # Adjust the temperature parameters for transformations
    temperature_forward = 10.0
    temperature_sustained_speed = 5.0
    temperature_heading = 5.0

    # Transforming the rewards for scaling
    transformed_reward_forward_speed = torch.exp(reward_forward_speed / temperature_forward) - 1
    transformed_sustained_speed = torch.exp(sustained_speed / temperature_sustained_speed) - 1  
    transformed_reward_heading = reward_heading  # No transformation necessary since it's normalized

        'reward_forward_speed': transformed_reward_forward_speed,
        'sustained_speed': transformed_sustained_speed,
        'reward_heading': transformed_reward_heading,
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Key Changes:
- Added `reward_heading` to encourage the agent not only to move forward but also towards the target. 
- Adjusted the temperatures for improved scaling and differentiation across the reward components.
- Kept the transformations simple, optimizing the signal without excessive distortion, allowing the agent to learn the objectives clearly.

This approach aims to enhance the agent's ability to learn efficient running behaviors while maintaining direction toward the goal, ultimately improving task performance and stability.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 300 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
reward_forward_speed: ['0.00', '0.34', '0.53', '0.71', '0.84', '1.01', '0.97', '1.02', '1.06', '1.15'], Max: 1.29, Mean: 0.84, Min: 0.00

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Let's carefully analyze the feedback provided on the individual reward components and consider how we can improve each of them to enhance the learning effectiveness of the RL agent.

### Analysis of Existing Reward Components:

1. **reward_forward_speed**:
   - **Values**: Ranged from 0.00 to 1.29, with a mean of 0.84. It's clear that the agent is capable of optimizing forward speed, but the reward is relatively low. 
   - **Action**: I recommend increasing the temperature while maintaining the exponential function to promote more sensitivity to changes in speed. We will retain this component but improve its influence.

2. **sustained_speed**:
   - **Values**: Ranged from 0.06 to 6.23, with a mean of 3.40. This component is providing substantial feedback, but its maximum is much larger than the other components.
   - **Action**: We should normalize the sustained speed within reason. By making it significantly larger than the other components, it could overshadow them, so we will employ an exponential transformation with a higher temperature.

3. **reward_heading**:
   - **Values**: All values are 0.00, indicating that this component is not providing any meaningful feedback.
   - **Action**: We need to rewrite this component to ensure it can encourage not only speed but also proper direction toward the target. We can base this on the alignment of the ant's velocity vector with the target direction.

4. **task_score**:
   - **Values**: Ranged from 0.02 to 6.52, with a mean of 4.83. The task score shows promise, but the minimum indicates potential performance issues.
   - **Action**: We can leverage its connection to the other reward components while ensuring it doesn't dominate the overall score.

5. **episode_lengths**:
   - **Values**: Varied widely, reflects possible inconsistencies in performance.
   - **Action**: This isn't directly part of the reward function but can hint at the need for sustained performance which we can indirectly promote through the speed components.

### Revised Reward Function Code:

Based on the analysis above, here is the new reward function that integrates improvements:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, dt: float, targets: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Unpack the root states
    torso_velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]  # Velocity components
    forward_velocity = torso_velocity[:, 0]  # Forward velocity (x-axis)
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]
    
    # Calculate distance to the target (2D, ignoring height)
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    distance_to_target = torch.sqrt(to_target[:, 0]**2 + to_target[:, 1]**2)

    # New reward components
    reward_forward_speed = forward_velocity  # Reward based on forward speed
    sustained_speed = torch.max(forward_velocity, torch.tensor(0.0, device=root_states.device))  # Only positive forward velocity matters
    
    # New heading reward based on the direction towards the target
    direction_to_target = to_target / (distance_to_target.unsqueeze(-1) + 1e-5)  # Normalize direction
    heading_dot_product = torch.sum(torso_velocity * direction_to_target, dim=-1)  # Dot product gives alignment

    # Adjust the temperature parameters for transformations
    temperature_forward = 5.0
    temperature_sustained_speed = 8.0
    temperature_heading = 5.0

    # Transforming the rewards for scaling
    transformed_reward_forward_speed = torch.exp(reward_forward_speed / temperature_forward) - 1
    transformed_sustained_speed = torch.exp(sustained_speed / temperature_sustained_speed) - 1  
    transformed_reward_heading = torch.exp(heading_dot_product / temperature_heading)  # Exponential for the heading

    # Total reward calculation
    total_reward = transformed_reward_forward_speed + transformed_sustained_speed + transformed_reward_heading

    # Create a dictionary for the individual reward components
    reward_components = {
        'reward_forward_speed': transformed_reward_forward_speed,
        'sustained_speed': transformed_sustained_speed,
        'reward_heading': transformed_reward_heading,
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Changes Made:
- **Enhanced `reward_forward_speed`**: Reduced temperature to allow more fine adjustments to speed feedback.
- **Adjusted `sustained_speed`**: Increased temperature to scale it down relative to other components.
- **Implemented `reward_heading`**: Introduced a meaningful heading reward based on the agent's alignment to the target direction, using the dot product to measure effectiveness towards location.
  
This revised reward function should provide a better balance and clearer signals for the RL agent to optimize running forward quickly, efficiently targeting destinations, and providing more robust learning dynamics moving forward.

[2024-10-19 03:43:54,033][root][INFO] - Iteration 4: GPT Output Content:
Let's analyze the provided policy feedback and reward components in detail to enhance the learning of the RL agent effectively.

### Analysis of Reward Components:

1. **reward_forward_speed**:
   - **Values**: The minimum value starts at 0.01, and the maximum observed is 7.58, with a mean of 4.55. This indicates variability in the achieved forward speed but does not fully utilize the range, as it is mostly below 8. 
   - **Action**: We can retain this component but increase its sensitivity and overall contribution to the reward. Adjusting the temperature may help in exaggerating the effects of forward speed improvements.

2. **sustained_speed**:
   - **Values**: The max is 2.72, mean is 1.78, and minimum is 0.04. The values are relatively low and clustered, showing limited optimization.
   - **Action**: Let's decrease the temperature to give a more pronounced impact on this reward. Additionally, we can calculate the sustained speed as a more defined time-averaged speed over the previous episodes.

3. **reward_heading**:
   - **Values**: With a maximum of 8.55 and a mean of 5.54, this component produces substantial feedback. However, it may not directly correlate with agent’s forward motion during training.
   - **Action**: Although it has high values, keeping it too high might overshadow other components. I would suggest normalizing this and scaling it down to maintain balance with the forward rewards.

4. **task_score**:
   - **Values**: This component seems to yield greater variability, from -0.01 to 9.96, with a mean of 7.33. The negative minimum suggests that agents may be performing poorly occasionally.
   - **Action**: We should consider employing a capped exponential transformation to avoid extreme penalties and normalize the effect of this reward component.

5. **episode_lengths**:
   - **Values**: Episode lengths range from 44.33 to 997.11. The high variability indicates performance inconsistencies.
   - **Action**: We will not directly include this into the reward, but this suggests the need for the agent to maintain a continuous improvement strategy in the run to stabilize its performance.

### Revised Reward Function:

Based on the points above, here is a new reward function designed to optimize performance while keeping the feedback balanced:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, dt: float, targets: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Unpack the root states
    torso_velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]  # Velocity components
    forward_velocity = torso_velocity[:, 0]  # Forward velocity (x-axis)
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]

    # Calculate distance to the target (2D, ignoring height)
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    distance_to_target = torch.sqrt(to_target[:, 0]**2 + to_target[:, 1]**2)

    # Enhanced reward components
    reward_forward_speed = forward_velocity  # Reward based on forward speed
    sustained_speed = torch.mean(forward_velocity)  # Averaging for sustained speed

    # New heading reward based on the direction towards the target
    direction_to_target = to_target / (distance_to_target.unsqueeze(-1) + 1e-5)  # Normalize direction
    heading_dot_product = torch.sum(torso_velocity * direction_to_target, dim=-1)  # Dot product gives alignment

    # Adjust the temperature parameters for transformations
    temperature_forward = 3.0  # Increase sensitivity
    temperature_sustained_speed = 1.5  # Lower to boost effect
    temperature_heading = 3.0  # Keep alignment effective, but normalized

    # Transforming the rewards for scaling
    transformed_reward_forward_speed = torch.exp(reward_forward_speed / temperature_forward) - 1
    transformed_sustained_speed = torch.exp(sustained_speed / temperature_sustained_speed) - 1  
    transformed_reward_heading = torch.clamp(torch.exp(heading_dot_product / temperature_heading), max=10.0)  # Exponential with cap

    # Total reward calculation
    total_reward = transformed_reward_forward_speed + transformed_sustained_speed + transformed_reward_heading

    # Create a dictionary for the individual reward components
    reward_components = {
        'reward_forward_speed': transformed_reward_forward_speed,
        'sustained_speed': transformed_sustained_speed,
        'reward_heading': transformed_reward_heading,
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Key Changes Made:
- **Increased sensitivity** of the `reward_forward_speed` component and adjusting its temperature for more pronounced outcomes.
- **Sustained speed** reward was averaged to ensure it reflects a clear estimate of performance over time instead of isolated moments.
- **Normalized and bounded** the `reward_heading` component to prevent it from overshadowing or inducing erratic behavior.
- **Overall transformation** adjustments were made to maintain a good scale among components, ensuring fair contributions towards the total reward.

This revised function should help the RL agent optimize its forward running task more effectively, providing the necessary signals to encourage consistent performance.

sustained_speed: ['0.01', '2.81', '4.83', '8.04', '11.52', '13.81', '18.62', '17.76', '16.66', '16.66'], Max: 19.99, Mean: 11.71, Min: 0.01 
reward_heading: ['1.04', '2.48', '3.17', '3.92', '4.44', '4.77', '5.23', '5.10', '5.04', '5.07'], Max: 5.32, Mean: 4.22, Min: 1.04 
task_score: ['0.02', '1.99', '2.63', '3.28', '3.77', '4.01', '4.43', '4.37', '4.27', '4.28'], Max: 4.53, Mean: 3.53, Min: 0.01 
episode_lengths: ['45.00', '655.42', '728.23', '810.39', '811.55', '829.00', '881.81', '873.28', '851.75', '818.10'], Max: 899.14, Mean: 792.98, Min: 45.00 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
